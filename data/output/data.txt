Decent offer, but it sucks that they don’t pay for housing. I’m interviewing for Big Ns/HFTs right now and if I get an offer from any of them I’ll most likely accept it over JPM. That doesn’t mean JPM is a bad company in any way, I really enjoyed my time there last summer. I just don’t wanna pay for housing lol

I had planned to shotgun apply and try to get as many offers as possible this year, but uni has been taking a huge toll on me so I accepted the first offer I got. Not trying to downplay the offer, but it does disappoint me that I wasn't able to get anything from many large companies this year even to have on the table

AMAA as always

**School/Year**: 4th year/5 @ non-Go8 uni

**Prior Experience:** internship @ locally known non-software company, [see earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a2mafb/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/eazmi0h/). Also reasonably substantial side projects

(Accepted this one)

**Company/Industry:** Mid-sized (100-1000 employees) software/hardware company

**Title:** SWE Intern

**Location:** Brisbane

**Duration:** 10-12 weeks, pretty flexible so I'm not sure how long it'll end up being

**Salary:** ~31/hour including super 

**Relocation/Housing Stipend:** None, local

---

Standard offer for Brisbane is ~30/hour for SWE/Engineering jobs in general. Every offer I have heard from someone I know is ~30/hour with limited variation, provided the company is reasonable size. Obviously unpaid internships exist as well (in large numbers) but I have rarely seen paid ones which offer more than ~33/hour. The only company I can think of in Brisbane which may offer that level is Amazon, iirc their Brisbane offer is ~90k/year starting wage.

Starting salaries are also within the 60k-70k/year range for most of these companies so it's no surprise that intern offers are so close.

---

Limited application stats for the internship season if anyone is interested:

Offer: 1 (after coding test/interview)

Some response (video interview mostly): local SaaS company (failed VI), Expedia (already signed offer at this point), Amazon (see previous, kinda regret not going forward with it but didn't want to reneg), Atlassian (failed coding test), Optiver (failed coding test)

Ghosted: Google, Canva, local startup (this one was a winter internship though)

Still haven't gotten a response from big G, didn't want to go through with Amazon even though I would love to work there since I wanted to go to a smaller company this summer. The whole big corporation feeling last summer was the part I disliked about the internship, was hoping to get away from that this summer and get to do some potentially higher impact work

> This thread is for sharing recent internship offers you've gotten, **new grad and experienced dev threads will be on Wednesday and Friday, respectively.**
am i reading this correctly? you're getting paid 20k to work for 3 months plus 7k to blow on rent? that's awesome.
May I ask how you prepared? I have a similar experience of getting rejected left and right and I am a rising junior, also at a top school, but I feel like being at this school hasn't done much for me.
WTF. I'm so starting this fucking degree this fucking year. For an internship. 7k. For an internship.

Why the downvotes? I want to start a degree in a well paying field and get downvotes? I am not the only one who wants a well paying position. I like warm showers, having housing, and non welfare food to eat. If you're not aware there are people with BAs in humanities/social sciences making $12/hr. I don't know why its offense to revel in the fact that someone without a degree is making over $40/hr without even having their degree yet and expressing that I would like to follow in those footsteps.
Wow, Google is becoming really cheap. I'm shocked it's still part of the Big 4.
How did u get ur google offer already? Host matching hasn’t even started yet
[deleted]
Did you receive a signing bonus for the internship positions? I've never seen that before
Assuming the Chicago offer is IMC. I heard some people were getting 10k signing bonuses and others 5k. Do you mind me asking if u go to a target or not? You can PM me if you want.

Also, which hedge fund? BW? Please PM
did amazon raise their offer?
I mean even if you paid for housing you'd still have like $6k in "fuck you" money bro.
Congrats dude! If you don't mind, how was your experience interviewing with Jane Street and Akuna compared to the other companies you interviewed with?
"okay canadian school"
that would be 15k / mo?
Is this Apple or is there another Big N company in Cupertino that needs hardware interns?
[deleted]
Sweet! I knew I wasn't the only Aussie here. Are you doing a double degree?
whoa. Firstly, congrats!  Sounds like an amazing offer. 

Could you tell me about the process. When did you apply? did you negotiate the offer or not? what was the application and interview process like?
That's great for Charlotte!!! Enjoy!
[deleted]
I did this last summer :) interesting time.
what the fuck
Damn that’s crazy. I have my phone interview with them on Tuesday, any idea what to expect?
[deleted]
Did you negotiate their offer up? I think their offer last year was closer to $10,500/mo. Also, do you happen to know if it'd be possible to extend the internship to say 12-14 weeks? I have an interview for them coming up!
I'm just curious - how much studying do you have to do to pass the interviews for these top fintech companies? Of course it's gonna differ for everyone, but every data point helps for me I guess to give myself a rough idea of how much I should be studying.
Ga state university? Is that you?
No just a big tech company. I don't want to give the company name away so I'll leave it there.
[deleted]
And that's $7k AFTER tax, which is more like $13,000 pre tax. I have friends at Google who got ~$4800 after the $9k stipend is taxed. Interns also get $500 per month for transportation, which means OP is making more like $7850 / mo
You only get that if you're really really good, with some luck of course. Tbh high-end internships like at FAANG or trading firms are really hard to come by and only really represent the top 5% of CS students. I hate to say it but unless you're a top student at a top university and/or you had a huge paradigm shift in terms of work ethic and skills, it's near impossible to just jump into high-paying internships.
>why the downvotes?

Mate, you have 3 fucking downvotes. Stop overreating.
Scroll down. 12.5k for an internship.
The downvotes are because your comment makes it seem like all you need to do to get an internship like this is change your major. That's far from the truth.

I think it's probably because other companies finally realize how important talent is and are trying to catch up to Google. Plus, Google is so big that they can't be *as* picky with talent like smaller unicorns or HFT firms can be
Return intern
I am just gonna doxx myself and said I went to Drexel University. My school has a coop program like Waterloo where everyone is required to do three 6-month internship (srsly, go search it up), so actually most CS students from here have 3 internship before they graduate. I split mine into 6 internships, each 3 month. Most people intern at companies that are local in state but I got lucky and score an internship with Google sophomore year. The second one was a return offer from Google. There have been students who also do 4 internship at Big N, such as 2 at Microsoft and 2 at Amazon, but this is not common (think 5-10 people out of a 700-800 from our school). Yet while this is statistically rare, it is stereotypical and shortsighted of you presume that student from lower ranked schools cannot get in meritocratically.
Yeah they were signing bonuses for internship positions
Palo Alto is probably the most expensive place on this planet tho. Also CA taxes ain’t no joke
I think he's from UAlberta not UW
This is Apple. I think every Big N has their own hardware division, but Apple hires more hardware engineers overall. At its core, Apple is still a hardware company.
Overtime
Yup, I've got a year left of almost exclusively eng courses. The dual degree program seems to be quite popular and a good talking point in interviews
Thanks!

Applied in May and got an interview in about 2 weeks. They pay based off your completed co-op terms and since my school only has 5 terms I negotiated to a 6th term pay scale. Application was from my campus recruitment and interview was an hour long interview with 2 ppl. It was a object oriented class diagram question with a couple hr qs as well

Pm for more info
I just applied and got a hackerrank email immediately as well.
I think this highlights just how difficult getting into the trading companies is. You were the least experienced with an existing internship, TA position, and side projects. This means that you can’t reasonably expect to get into Optiver or similar with no experience as a rising junior. 

I’m a senior (5th year now since I switched paths late) and I never knew how important it is to start early. Projects early, leetcode early, internships early.

I think a good amount of CS students have the aptitude to get into the top tier of companies, but to even get that chance you have to be building your skills for years.

On coding challenges companies have so many metrics these days beyond correctness, including how long you spent working and other things we probably don’t even know about. That makes it even more important to stand out.
Depends on the company. Some are straight leetcode, some are more system designy and open ended. I personally did not prepare a lot for most of my interviews.
The official language at the company is English, so just English is fine! It definitely helps to have some basic Japanese knowledge though.
Wait I assumed my lump sump would be taxed cause I heard my google friends get taxed as u mentioned. I assumed Microsoft wouldn’t be any different
:/ I did get into top unis/every uni including Berkeley, I applied to and was a top student just not in stem. I did supplemental instruction for algebra and was top of all my math courses with highest on exams/perfect scores but the last class I had was college algebra and honestly my peers were lazy not the type of competition that will be at the top schools. And then the final, I didn't get a perfect score and was honestly stumped by the newer concepts we learned and that was just college algebra. I was lazy too and studied last minute - which honestly scares me because I didn't have to put much effort into getting As - so I never did - but from what I've heard pre calc/calc/physics/cs are not like that which is fine because I want the challenge/mental stimulation. At the same time you can't bs your way through and be on top or even pass. I'm pretty sure I won't bs but I remember having stats and how the hw was problems that took hours and I just stopped doing the homework because it took so long. 


I just think poverty is worse at this time and those salaries look amazing and I think it'd be awesome to make apps and things (also interested in robotics) though so I can sit my ass down for hours and do the assignments.
Bruh, where are you getting overreaction. Come off it, you act like I threatened to murder someone.
I saw, I just got overwhelmed and left. Are there trolls here. Is this really real. I'm about to find out.
If you assume that from like 2 sentences, I don't think I'm the one with the problem. The potential is there. It stands to reason if I have the same or as similar credentials as that poster, I could get the same or similar results. Obviously there are other factors but what we do know is the person is in cs.
or alternatively, its labor day and I have time, seems like you're really salty with that comment tho
lmao dumbass

Ahh from EP to SWE? I’m a returning SWE intern and G didn’t guarantee my offer until after I get matched, rip
what was the interview process like?
How much experience do you have in programming in general? And how developed were your projects by your first internship? Its really impressive to have those internships by your junior year. Good job man
They pay the tax witholdings. Can confirm this personally.
FYI undergraduate/"college" algebra typically refers to ring theory, group theory, Galois theory, etc.

If you are going to a school like UCSD/UCLA/UCB, most of your peers that you are competing with for Big N internships are going to take multivariable calculus or above for their first college math class. They also will understand the game to get ahead in this field and competition is going to be rough.

That said, I do think your reasons for wanting to pursue this career are good. Few people going into college have the foresight on their own to realize the important factors in choosing a career path.
If I were you, I wouldn't be too stressed if that's the case but don't become complacent; it's really easy to fall into that trap in your freshman year. Also, if you're doing CS for the money only it gets harder to stay motivated. 

I don't want to put you down or anything but university is a whole different level from HS. Being the top in HS, maybe means you're a less than average student in a top university. It also becomes less and less about individual classes and more about general competence and work ethic. This is especially true for intern and job interviews where they don't usually care what your GPA is so long as its higher than a 3.6ish. They mostly care whether about problem solving skills and the ability to work well in a team.

If you end up going Berkley, then you probably wouldn't have to worry about not getting a job or poverty, though I don't wanna assume personal circumstances. I'm just trying to make the distinction that internships that pay 7k+ a month are much much harder to come by than this sub-reddit makes it seem.

edit: I realize I come across kinda harsh. You can do it. Most if not all can as well. It's just that it's much harder than it seems. Feel free to PM me if you want advice on this stuff. There's a lot things I'd have done differently in my academic career if I'd known then what I know now.
this is real, these top companies have to compete against each other for top talent. that also means they have to pay top dollar
Yes it’s definitely real. Most of the big tech companies will be 7-9k, and then trading and hedge funds will be 11-13k. And then the vast majority of normal jobs are like $20 per hour.
it's Microsoft, so yeah
This one is not so bad. OP is a junior with previous unpaid local experience. Further down guys have had FAANG exp in sophomore and freshman years which is mind boggling to me
100% real, my friend was payed $135k pro rated PLUS housing over the summer in Chicago.
Firstly, you asked why you were getting downvoted and I gave you an answer. If you didn't want one, then don't ask.

Imagine someone saying something like "WTF. I'm so becoming an actor this year. 10 million dollars in one year. For a single movie."

The person saying that sounds pretty naive don't they? You're that person right now and your second comment demonstrates it too.

>It stands to reason if I have the same or as similar credentials as that poster, I could get the same or similar results

No. Not necessarily and in fact, the odds aren't in your favor. This subreddit is filled with tons of people who are already in the major, going to career fairs, polishing their resumes, and applying to all the big companies without getting any results. It's great that you're optimistic but to answer your question again, you're getting downvoted because you seem naive or overconfident.
I’m not the one who can’t get an internship 🤷‍♀️
From what I’ve heard: Google still pays well, just not as well as other places these days

People apply there because it pays well

They can’t be as picky because they need a LOT of engineers, and if they increased intern pay (which is standard for interns, usually non negotiable) then some interns would be overpaid, because of the slightly diluted talent. And this isn’t a knock on google in any way at all—I’m just saying some other places are now equal to or better than them in talent

I don’t work at google, I’m just saying what I’ve heard here. Perhaps someone more familiar can give a better answer

Just to point out with your question, just because somewhere can’t be picky doesn’t mean it pays well. Places like Raytheon can’t be picky, do they pay well? (Rhetorical question. Answer is no)
Hackerrank/Hirevue then on campus interview
Thanks! I took a year of APCS in high school and that was really all my experience was before college. I took more CS classes, especially systems classes, than most other students my year, so I definitely learned a significant amount in my first two years.
Do you know how much the salary gets taxed in Redmond by any chance? Like how much would I be taking monthly after taxes
> Also, if you're doing CS for the money only it gets harder to stay motivated. 

I really don't see it that way. I know that gets spewed around a lot but I know people who chose dream majors but are miserable because they are low paying, no direct job opportunities. Owning a home in my home state CA, having a family not live in poverty, having health insurance, not having to stress constantly is the motivation. I also have an interest in building/creating things. I just never had a background/was around people in those fields so it seemed far away from me and unattainable and now I simply do not care about any of that.

>If you end up going Berkley, then you wouldn't have to worry about not getting a job or poverty, though I don't wanna assume personal circumstances. 

I don't know, there are people I know that have degrees from UCLA/UCB that aren't in the employment areas I would have imagined or doing as well. People with law degrees. School isn't so important as much as the person, work ethic, ambition, discipline, public vs private sector, and negotiating your fucking salary are. I look on transparent California which lists people's salaries and its so sad because there are people with BAs making 30k and secretaries making 60k. I had a mentor with a degree from UCB decades ago still making 60k in her 60s. She's never topped 6 figures. Just stopped after bachelors. I don't consider that successful or notable. It works for her but for me no. 

> I'm just trying to make the distinction that internships that pay 7k+ a month are much much harder to come by than this subreddit makes it seem.

Thank you for that. There's also posts about people being unemployed for months but its like my mind ignores those and focuses on the 7k internship. Its still important to note that there are plenty jobs and the average salary for a person with just a CS degree is pretty high.
I just. What are these applicants doing? Do they already have numerous websites and apps? They're still in school, some juniors. I get some people have been doing this since high school, I wish they mentioned it. Part of me is terrified because I have zero computer experience and have not taken the prereqs. I'll be starting fresh but I'm a hard worker and these numbers are extremely motivating and I'm sure I can overcome any class/hurdle in school for that $$ but its like is this possible for someone starting absolutely from scratch?
just damn, they really value swes and invest in them, amazing
Honestly, I'm starting to get it. Jobs and Gates started when they were kids and they were kids in what the 70s. The privileged have had computers for a long time. But think about it even middle class had computers in the 2000s. People born in 2000 are in college now, they grew up with tech. In certain areas like the SV the tech companies are active with schools, elementary schools and middle schools. Its not that hard to believe if you think about it. They are programming in high school and middle school, their parents saw the writing on the wall and got them around it and their interest took from there. 

I remember a stat teacher saying how he had his kids doing multiples with toys and was teaching them calculus as children so they excelled at math. Daughter ended up in basic field but son got a Phd from Stanford in stem field.
135k just for the summer?
\>Imagine someone saying something like "WTF. I'm so becoming an actor this year. 10 million dollars in one year. For a single movie."

Perfect, perfect analogy. The vast majority of students I know are making $21/hr on average. Only myself and 1 other person I know are even above $30. While software engineers will always be well off and in the middle class, it's very statistically unlikely any engineer will get rich (though it can happen with a combination of a lot of hard work and luck)
> Firstly, you asked why you were getting downvoted and I gave you an answer. If you didn't want one, then don't ask.

First: Am I somehow not allowed to respond to answers because I asked for an answer? 


Second: It was rhetorical, these are fake internet points, I couldn't give a damn.


Third: The person saying that sounds pretty naive don't they? You're that person right now and your second comment demonstrates it too.

And yet here we all are. I'm sure every last person here is driven solely on their immense interest in CS and not at all by the notion that following in a similar path as people earning cs salaries will lead to a similar salary. Come off it. You sound naïve, dishonest, and unrealistic. 

>Imagine someone saying something like "WTF. I'm so becoming an actor this year. 10 million dollars in one year. For a single movie."

And yet every year people go to Hollywood or start acting school in the hopes that they'll attain that or something similar. You can manipulate it into solely that 10 million figure but it still stands acting in many capacities is lucrative. Even extras and ads. 

>No. Not necessarily and in fact, the odds aren't in your favor. 

Again, come off it. It stands to reason if I have the same or as similar credentials as that poster, I could get the same or similar results. You sound pathetic and sad, deliberately twisting ish.
They'll withhold a shit load since it's so much money. You'll probably pocket ~$5500 a month and get all of the rest when it's tax refund season (assuming you don't make a ton of money on the side or somethin)
It's definitely okay to be motivated by money but it shouldn't be the only thing. Software engineering can be very tedious, boring, and/or incredibly frustrating at times (or all at once) and being motivated by only money can make it difficult to slog through those phases.  I'm not doubting that you don't have passion for building things and problem solving but definitely keep in mind that CS and SE require lots of patience and tenacity for those difficult parts. That's why companies like Microsoft pay a lot for people that can get successfully through tough, long, tedious problems.

> If you end up going Berkley, then you wouldn't have to worry about not  getting a job or poverty, though I don't wanna assume personal  circumstances. 

The reason why I brought that up is typically, students from top universities in their field, tend to have both a high employment (prior to graduating, and in their desired field) rate and continuing education (master, PhD, etc) rates. UIUC's College of Engineering for instance [reported](https://uofi.app.box.com/s/ml9oh48vawrhm7e019kw5ix4j91j605p) only 6% for those still seeking or are undecided in terms of employment.  School is definitely not as important as those other factors you mentioned but it is a strong indicator of those factors and of future success.

Regarding salaries, employers pay more for employees that they think can provide more value. That means convincing hiring managers that you're more capable than what they think you are and showing that the extra capability requires extra compensation. Either through hard work, previous experience, etc or through showing that other companies think you're worth more then they think you are. The keyword is convincing, meaning having enough visibility with those who have a say in your salary and, in effect, showing off your clout. People who are good at this, through raw talent and/or corporate-speak, get their high salaries and those who aren't or don't care enough can get short changed. More money does unfortunately mean more problems and responsibilities to deal with. If they're paying top dollar, they expect top performance, long hours, etc and if an employee can't put up with it, they usually get fired or demoted. That's the way I see it and I think the majority of this sub shares that sentiment. 

On a closing note, I hope it didn't seem like I was trying to badger you. You definitely don't have to take this stuff at face value. I'm just sharing a bit of what I've learned which would hopefully be helpful in the future.
For the 12.5k trading tier, I’d say most already have substantial experience. In this thread the guy who got Jane Street (trading firm in NYC) already had 4 internships somehow. One kid from my school got an Optiver internship (also 12.5k but in Chicago) and he had had previous internships and projects as well. These companies are harder to get into than even google typically.

Your Big N internships (google, FB, Amazon, Microsoft, and similar) are more manageable. A previous internship definitely helps but here it is easier to break in for your first internship.

Overall if you are just starting as a freshman, projects are important and leetcode is important. Apply to every possible internship you can, whether you think you’ll get rejected or not, every year. Brand name does not matter for freshman year or sophomore year. Anything would be good.
hey, i was in a similar situation as you when I was a freshman. only prev experience in CS was AP CS in high school, but that barely counts. we just made randon stuff and didnt learn much.

By the time I became a junior though, I gained enough skills from school + side projects + interview practicing (Leetcode mainly) to get an internship offer from Amazon. So it's definitely not impossible to do, but it takes a bit of luck to get an interview and a bit of work to pass it.

$135k prorated + luxury housing in downtown Chicago. He probably made ~33k over the summer.
Come on man. You sound like you're not even a CS major and you're making claims about the industry like you've been working for years. I stand my ground and I think most people who have worked in the industry will agree that even if you have the same credentials as the poster, you probably won't get similar results. It's kind of a crapshoot and the people you know matters way more than your credentials.

I'm not saying you shouldn't come into the industry. Things are awesome here and there's nothing wrong with being driven by salary (please tell me where I ever claimed that because I'm pretty sure I didn't). I'm just saying that it's much harder than you think and I want you try keeping things in perspective so you don't make a post complaining about how we're in a recession or that there are no jobs when the going gets tough.

As for the "rhetorical" question. Clearly you cared about downvotes enough to see your score and edit your comment. Don't kid yourself.
" It was rhetorical, these are fake internet points, I couldn't give a damn. " Lmao. Then why make the one-paragraph post about it. LOL
I listed more than money somewhere else but also think money is enough for me. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. You might not understand very well what happens if you don't have money but I've seen enough to know that having money is incredibly important.

>The reason why I brought that up is typically

I totally get it. I was just saying that I've watched enough people and known enough people to see that its pretty much case by case. Not everyone even goes to college to be employed or produce some are looking for a spouse, some are filling a void. Not to mention as the full house mom fiasco illustrated, many degrees from top schools are straight bought, the ivies have a long history of legacy admits, big names, and children of donors.

>More money does unfortunately mean more problems and responsibilities to deal with. If they're paying top dollar, they expect top performance

Of course. But you have to be aware there are people dealing with awful shit as waiters, working at mcdonalds, and working in retail. People being cussed out, spat on, assaulted, having to work 2 full time minimum wage jobs, do harsh physical labor, loading unloading, work in the field during high temperatures for minimum wage, with no health insurance, no mobility, no negotiations. I don't think some of you guys realize that people in minimum wage jobs deal with the exact same things - while making minimum wage. They're still expected to perform. At 16 I worked at carls jr, we had to have drive thru times under 3 minutes and 30 seconds, every shift, during lunch rush, no matter how you're feeling, no matter if you're having a bad day. I knew a farm worker who was pregnant and still had to work in the field and miscarried. You have to perform at every job. I was at a restaurant last week and people took back the waitresses tip over something trivial, imagine a bunch of people doing that, they also gave her a nasty attitude. 


>long hours

With the long hours, again people are working 80 hr weeks making minimum wage. I'm from CA, min wage is like $12, are you aware even in the shitty places rent is at least $1000. You pay income tax and fed tax, bills, transportation, etc. And that $1000 place is in the worst parts that are dangerous and stressful to live in so you fuck up your health and sanity living there which is priceless. 

>they usually get fired or demoted. That's the way I see it and I think the majority of this sub shares that sentiment. 

People are getting fired from target, mcdonalds, and starbucks too. That's every job. Not unique to cs at all. People are getting fired from amazons warehouses. 



>On a closing note, I hope it didn't seem like I was trying to badger you. You definitely don't have to take this stuff at face value. I'm just sharing a bit of what I've learned which would hopefully be helpful in the future.

I totally get that some think because of a single comment I have unrealistic expectations but the reality is the average salary is high, jobs are plentiful, and if you can complete a degree in cs it shows a level of competency, strength, intelligence and dedication that reasonable can be transferred into an okay paying salary.
Can you apply with no coding experience. What is the minimum experience they want, areas of knowledge. Because I was previously social science so highest level of math they require is college algebra/stats. No physics, nothing. I'm wondering if I take c++ and learn that are there internships?
[deleted]
Not true. I have two friends at Jane Street and Akuna who didn't have prior experience. It's more about whether you can pass the interviews...
That last "A" is for "anything"...


What was your hs background like, were you into programming/computers then? Were you already coding? Did you have a portfolio/GitHub/sample projects?


What were your graduating math and science - mostly physics levels?


Most difficult class?

How many internships did you apply to?

What resources did you use to find your internship?

Who were your references (vague answer like professor, neighbor, etc, don't need their name and address) and how many?


Where did you go, what did you use to get your resume up to par and your cover letter?

Most helpful tip? Anything to keep in mind? What has helped you the most? How do you keep your focus?

Did they make any offers for a follow up internship? 

How was your experience there? Workload? Culture?
Come off it, no claims have been made. You sound like a troll, pathetic and like a failure. I can't help you with all that.
Why be on reddit at all. What are we all doing here? Paypal me some money and I'll find something better to do.
>You might not understand very well what happens if you don't have money  but I've seen enough to know that having money is incredibly important.

I don't think that's necessarily fair to say that I don't know how living close to poverty line is like. While my family and I haven't been in extremely dire situations, growing up lower-middle class through the financial crisis, and living among people in worse financial situations, gives you a very good idea how bad things be.

>I was just saying that I've watched enough people and known enough people to see that its pretty much case by case.

The keyword I said was typically. University name, GPA, etc still matters quite a lot to employers despite recent scandals. Employers will go to UCLA and Stanford's career fairs in droves and be far more accommodating than a small state or private school with not that much of a reputation, despite that scandal.

>I don't think some of you guys realize that people in minimum wage jobs  deal with the exact same things - while making minimum wage.

I think you'd be very surprised to find that a lot of "us guys" had to work those same minimum wage jobs and know what you're referring to.  I worked at McDonald's and a community service organization for special needs kids in high school and I do know how hard it can be. I knew how bad service and entry-level min wage jobs can be which is why I went to college. As for doing CS, I found that I like the problem-solving aspect and that I can deal with some particularly difficult situations.

The keyword in what I said earlier is value. A software engineer can create a lot more value than what someone who works a min wage job does due to the power of automation. Case in point, self-driving cars, robotic assembly lines, robotic cooking ware for restaurants, etc.

Also, white-collar jobs can be very high stress in their own way. People can and do develop mental health issues, burn out entirely,  become obese, get high blood pressure, heart disease etc. All the social stresses you find in a school and elsewhere are present in these jobs except cranked up to 11 and that does take a toll on people, regardless of whether or not that's being accepted. Keep in mind that I'm not saying that's not present in blue-collar jobs; it definitely is among other things.  I also didn't imply that being fired or demoted is unique to CS/SE.

I'm not trying to be unsympathetic or callous but ad hominem attacks don't really help anyone. Everyone goes through their own shit and just because someone's shit is worse than another person's, it doesn't discount their dilemma.
You could try, but you probably wouldn’t get past any coding challenges without any coding experience.
I did the majority of my interview prep before school started on the fall. Now its mostly just keeping my skills sharp with a question or two a day
They probably were from a very top school with math Olympiad experience or something. Jane Street won’t let people without serious credentials even past the resume screen. Akuna might though.
And you sound like a loser. I give it 2 years before you burn out and drop out of CS.
> It stands to reason if I have the same or as similar credentials as that poster, I could get the same or similar results

If that isn't a claim then I don't know what is... I don't need your validation. I'm just trying to help an aspiring software engineer out. You can choose to take my advice or not but just be warned that the industry might not be what you think it is. If you have any questions for me feel free to ask and we can have a more constructive discussion.
> While my family and I haven't been in extremely dire situations, growing up lower-middle class through the financial crisis, and living among people in worse financial situations, gives you a very good idea how bad things be.

Sounds like your family had money, not a lot of it but there are straight up homeless children, I was one of them. To this day I still have issues with food.

>The keyword I said was typically.

Of course not all, in general, etc. And I'm sharing my perspective case by case.

>All the social stresses you find in a school and elsewhere are present in these jobs except cranked up to 11 and that does take a toll on people, regardless of whether or not that's being accepted.

I don't know dude, there are emts in low paying jobs and they are in literal life or death situations, its a different type of stress, no one is dying over code, its deadlines, money, and reputation. 

I don't know where you're getting ad hominem attacks or attacks period. I said what I said.. The issue here is some people think they are adding new information that is actually the standard regurgitated sentiment. Even the manner you stated it was as though we're on two different ways of thinking and everyone else is in agreement with your way of thinking. Not the case btw.  If we're honest your whole intent is to scare me off or put me in my place and put yourself above me. You're really just being contrarian and attempting to make yourself sound reasonable by warping my statements to make me sound unreasonable. You really took 2 sentences and manipulated it into this whole other thing which is frankly very odd. I have no clue why you would read someone marveling at an amount of money and saying they want to follow that path and think you need to slow their roll or try to stop them or interject as though there aren't stories of unemployment right on the front page and fuck ups among the top posts of this sub. I have no clue why YOU would chose yourself as the person to administer a reality check or whatever you want to call the bs you've been writing. What exactly is your whole point here. You can literally see in this very post already that not everyone is making that same amount so you had to realize you're not actually adding new information. So why are you actually taking time out of your day to be negative and make claims like that's not a possibility for you internet stranger, I know nothing about. Does that not seem odd to you?
are there cc classes where you could get that, do c++ classes not teach you how to code and have projects? java classes? do the certificate programs teach you those skills?
No. I personally know both of them and they're from my school which is a rank ~50 state school.
You sound pathetic. I knew you were just an angry, bitter person, trying to spread that. Did it take you 2 years to fail out because you're an idiot. Aw, sucks for you. I give you 6 months before you off yourself for being a nobody.
whatevs bruh I said what I said
> Sounds like your family had money, not a lot of it but there are  straight up homeless children, I was one of them. To this day I still  have issues with food. 

I'm sorry to hear that. Like I said I don't mean to be callous and insensitive. I do realize what I said comes off as condescending.

But like I said ad hominem and  now straw-man attacks don't help. I freely admitted that what I said is what has already been said multiple times among other things. 

> That's the way I see it and I think the majority of this sub shares that sentiment. 

All  I wanted to do was help because I would have wanted help when I started and I still do solicit help on here with things I face. Apparently I did a bad job of it. However, my intention was never to "scare you off or put you in my place..." I originally did find it odd as to why you were marveling at the amount and the fact that you seemed very intent on it. For the rest of my replies, I was just responding to your replies like anyone would do in a normal conversation, but it did turn into a rant war. It's definitely not my place nor was it my intention to "force" advice on internet strangers. So for all of that, I apologize.
I mean you need to have basic coding skills.

Then after you know the basics start to understand your algorithms and data structures really well. Then practice leetcode continuously and eventually you will become good at pattern recognition.

Then once you get the interviews it becomes much much easier.
That’s impressive then to get an interview at Jane Street with nothing special or prior experience. Everyone I know gets auto rejected on the resume round.
dude whatevs I said what I said. 7k for an internship, I'm getting this degree.
Yes, but I was asking if a c++ or java class would teach you those skills? Sometimes I hear cs majors don't learn how to code specifically.
The C++ or Java class is the very, very beginning.  Its a start but the people who typically get these internships are typically from a top 20 university or from a previously prestigious internship(not everyone gets an interview). After that, the main focus is on data structures and algorithms. You will learn the basics in the second programming class you take but you wont be really fluent unless you practice on your own time.

When people say CS majors dont learn how to code they mean that they took only the basic classes and know some stuff theoretically, but havent worked on large scale enough projects or products to deal with other issues as they come up. Or maybe, they took a lot of theoretical math classes later in their degree and havent recently practiced how to code. Or they cheated, whatever.  The average CS major does know how to code.

Very nice place to work. In addition to $22/hr I recieve PTO in-line with full timers, I can work remotely up to 4 days per week (though they recommended I don't do this unless I have a reason).

$22/hr isn't a ton, but my rent is $400 with utils included, so it's still mountains of money to me.

Google's intern salary is a bit less at around $35-40 per hour, but housing is provided if you need it and there's free meals in the office :)

PM if you want more info
which bank is it? I applied for RBC because I heard they pay the most
Hey, mind if I PM you, I finished freshman at UIUC as well and am very interested in the Chicago area!
Hey just reading through this thread now. I was an intern at Equifax last summer and your experience so far sounds consistent with mine. I would advise to be as proactive as possible about asking for work but sometimes there's just nothing you can do. Some interns did some cool stuff and had plenty of work and others did almost nothing. Best of luck regardless!
My salary was around 150$ per month in my first internship in my home country. In my current internship it's around 40 times that amount. No need to be depressed. If you want to work outside of Indonesia then study for it. Otherwise it's not low because you're not spending your money in a very expensive city then.
Hey buddy keep that head up! FWIW I make less than 30 year here in the states but I’m not a swe and rent in my town ranges from 600 a month for a shanti all the way to 5 a month for the mansion with all the amenities. Bright note is you could hone your skills and get employed in any of those markets. Even in my town you could start around 50 minimum
Have fun, pretty cool company.
See you soon😉
I am! With CAIDM. How did you know?

What's your TC if you don't mind sharing
As much as people like to bash Amazon on their lack of perks, they do spoil their interns silly when it comes to housing!
Yeah its weird. My initial offer had a high 7k number but when i got my official offer to sign it showed 8500. But hey jm not complaining
Higher COL cities make more
[deleted]
For companies at that tier, it’s actually on the lower end lmao (look at the Amazon guy above). Some companies even break $8-9k/month + your own apartment/hotel room
Hey fellow anteater! My internship is part Data Engineering and part Data Analysis so i received all sorts of questions relating to data engineering and data science so ymmv. If you got any questions, let me know!
Working on a startup, my ultimate goal is to have MS acquire it. Wanted to learn more about the company and make connections so I thought this wouldn’t be a bad way to do it.

I plan on interning at Google next summer (if things workout). I recently just got the ‘foobar’ challenge from them actually
It was okay. So basically round one is, you have a 30-40 min phone interview if you get selected it’s a little technical, mostly trying to find out if you’re technically competent (nothing crazy). 

Round 2 is the final round, there’s 5 interview back-to-back. They fly you out, and have 5 different technical interviews in 1 day with different engineers (it’s like a 5 hour event). Afterwords they come together and make decision and you’ll know within the week if they email you.
pm'd
Interested in this
It's been great! Definitely exceeded my initial expectations.
Yeah. I think first of all, it's not as hard as people make it out to be. You can definitely find one, but don't get discouraged if you're getting rejected to places. Every time I got rejected I applied to 3 new places.

Also keep updating your resume. If it's not working then try changing things.

Know your data structures and take a class on them as early as you can.

Don't lose hope if it's taking forever to hear back, Google repeatedly would go months at a time with little or no communication, and based off of my conversations with other interns this is totally normal. Lots of other companies can do the same.
happy cake day :)
Thanks! And yes, Linkedin hires just 3-5 APM interns each cycle (and I think same for TPM). It's the same at most companies, so it's even more important to network and get referrals whenever possible. Product teams often host events to show off new products so it's easy to network by going to them.

The process at most companies is phone screen with HR -> take home assignment -> phone screen with PM, mostly discussing the assignment -> in person interview.

Take home assignments are product sense, not coding challenges. I actually never had to code while interviewing at most of the Big Ns, but I did have to explain high-level feature implementation and ELI5 concepts like APIs. 

The product sense questions test how deeply you think about products. For example, someone might ask "What's your favorite product? What is wrong with it and how would you fix it? How would you redesign it for kids?". In each case you want to narrow the scope of the question ("I'm going to focus on kids 5-10 years old"), think creatively, and come up with pros and cons for your proposal. Then they'll ask how you'd measure the success of the feature and what it would mean if the metrics looked like (blank) instead of what you expected.

I can go into further detail if necessary!
I did a hackathon almost every weekend to get projects on my resume and stuff. Also studied leetcode for about 4 months. Try to reach out to a recruiter personally, or go via referral.
Good luck buddy!!
BMO, Scotiabank, and RBC pay their tech interns well, and within the same $2/hr (source: got offers from 2 of the 3 and have a friend who went to the third). TD and CIBC don't. I got an offer from TD 2 years ago that was around $19/hour, and I've heard CIBC pays about the same. Benefits like PTO and banking benefits vary among the 3 well-paying banks.
👌😍
This is a little late but I'm doing research with CAIDM too; I'm unavailable to come to the meetings/workshops because of my internship atm.
Yea I was adding the stipend
Standard New Grad Offer (NYC/SF is slightly higher)

$142.5k Y1, $138.5k Y2, $136k+ Y3 and 4

(reviews and promotions tend to be after 2 years)
Amazon pays more for NYC/Bay Area locations
Google is notorious for caring about GPA. There was even a post on this sub earlier this year where someone had their internship offer rescinded because of low GPA.

https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a1xqeo/verbal_offer_rescinded_due_to_gpa/
I've heard of people getting their packet getting a second review because of a sub 3.0 GPA though, post-interview and being told they would be getting an offer. It's not the most important aspect, but it is still a signal they use, I guess.
&#x200B;

What kind of languages do you use at your current intern? Do you have to build anything as part of the data engineering team?
Hi, may I ask approx how many days after applying did they contact you for phone screen/ first round of interview? Thanks!
Interesting, I thought they discontinued the foobar?
Thanks for the info! Is it mostly leetcode mediums for the onsite?
interested in this as well!
Thank you, and have fun at google!
For someone thinking about career paths, what is product management in comparison in to software engineering? Congrats by the way!
Pretty much spot on. 

Very similar process for Google APM:

- Touch base with recruiter

- Phone screen with a PM (product design)

- Assignment 

- 3x On-Site Interviews (1 system design with an Engineer, 2 product/estimation with an APM or a PM)

- Hiring Committee (didn't pass)
Depends I think. I have 2 friends at RBC being paid pretty eh (less than 20) and another at Scotia being paid min wage. They're all SWE interns afaik.
If that's the case, you should technically add your relo + signing bonus, and your stocks. That's a better comparison of TC (and yours will be higher!).. either way, Amazon is paying interns well!
>Google is notorious for caring about GPA. 

They're really not though. They care as much or less than other companies.   
I think microsoft and apple care about GPA a lot more.
Yes that happened to me. My GPA only made things harder, and caused lots of unnecessary (on my end) stress.
Yea like leetcode easy/mediums (mostly medium)
Thank you!

Product managers influence the direction of a company's products by considering both user needs and technical feasibility. For example, Reddit has /r/ideasfortheadmins. Someone needs to read the ideas, decide which ones are technically feasible and fit the company's overall vision, prioritize so that the most impactful ideas are developed first (and decide what "impactful" means in the company's context), and track how those features influence user and site behavior so that they can be changed as necessary. A PM's goal is to build a product that is actually usable by the intended consumers.

By working across engineering, business and design product managers develop a product strategy and convince (not tell) others to get on board. It's a lot of meetings and people interaction. Most tech companies want their product managers to be both technical and social so that they can communicate well with both engineers and business people.

The Google APM page and the Uber APM page are good at descriptions of the role and have examples of the projects that the APMs worked on!
You can kind of think of what PMs do as what co-founders of startups do whilst in the very early stages - i.e. decide what to build and why, test to see how users respond to what you've built, iterate on that, create a vision for that product going forward, handle all the intermediary processes between different iterations, get buy-in from all stakeholders for new ideas, handle the coordination between different cross-functional teams etc etc. 

Essentially each product/feature is like a mini-startup within a company that you're running and coordinating (hell, it could even *be* a legitimate startup). 

You don't **need** a technical background per se it just really helps in order to work better with engineers. Totally different career path to SWE and much more suited to people who enjoy business/strategy/design/bigger picture stuff as well as technical stuff.

Happy to say that seeing the previous internship salary thread motivated me to work harder on Leetcode and try to be able to post in the next one that happens. Sure enough, I got Amazon (which isn't the best but fuck it I'll take it). Good luck to those looking around and still trying to find an internship!

Since internship season has ended in AU I'm just here to give some data points on the openings that I've seen on job boards for internships next summer (2019-2020 here). Link to my post in the last thread for those interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a2mafb/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/eazmi0h/

Again I haven't actually gotten offers for the jobs below, just saw the postings (these are ones with salaries)

---

**Company/Industry:** Optiver

**Title:** Software Developer Intern

**Location:** Sydney

**Duration:** 12 weeks

**Salary:** $75,000 plus super (pro-rated) - for those outside AU super is just 401k, this means it'll probably be about 82.5k total assuming 10% super 

**Relocation/Housing Stipend:** Provided housing if outside of Sydney

Sidenote: their hackerrank was pretty damn tough so that 75k pro-rated is well deserved. Don't know how some of you guys do it tbh

---

**Company/Industry:** Tiny manufacturing shop

**Title:** Electical Eng/Software Eng Intern 

**Location:** Brisbane

**Duration:** flexible, during semester

**Salary:** 22.50/hour 

**Relocation/Housing Stipend:** None

---

As a side note, I've been talking to a lot of people I know from uni about their internships/work this last summer and the general figure of $30/hour seems very standard, at least for good engineering companies in Brisbane. Only notable exception I know of is a particularly large defence contractor (you can probably guess which), virtually every mining company, and if Amazon takes interns I would assume they pay a little higher as well. 

The company I was at had plenty of unpaid interns actually, which is unfortunately pretty common here because of the 30 day supervised work requirement for engineering students. It seems to be that a lot of the work is geared towards them, and the paid stuff (while good) is just a little less common.

Same here on Amazon...they said they wouldn't have more info until the summer, which was a bit surprising
dmed you about interning at amazon :) thank you
how do you have 2 startups and a government internship as a freshman? 
> Oil

> Bay Area

?? TIL
> I feel like an asshole for saying this, but I'm pretty disappointed with how internship hunting went for me this season.

Completely fair. You've got great outcomes here, but I reckon it's fine to share the sting of the screw-ups, particularly in this sub full of over-achievers.
How do you get recruiter's emails? The big companies have so many recruiters that trying to find them on LinkedIn can be difficult too.
So you're applying for internships for after you graduate? Are you hoping to immediately convert the internship or are you doing something else after the summer?
Don't be disappointed, Amazon in my opinion is up there with FB and G for internships. You don't need to do ops stuff so your WLB is good, and I heard they treat interns quite well. You are also gonna get amazing experience since all of their products are with scalability in mind. And of course, having A on your resume is a great boost. Grats!
We have the exact same story it’s honestly crazy. 
[deleted]
> This recruiting season has made me realize just how important reaching out to recruiters directly is. Off the top of my head, I interviewed for 8 pretty big names after emailing recruiters at those respective companies. So yeah, there's a tip.

How did you get the emails of recruiters to email them directly?
Did you get accepted this semester? If so, when you filled out the survey for interview timeslots, how long did it take for them to get back to you on a set time? And congrats by the way, these all sound like amazing offers!!
Hey man, Just wondering if you ended up getting 7650$ or 8500$ as most Sunnyvale interns get?
Wow, didn't know Google pays 7500 in MTV. Is this their base now for interns?
how did you accept two? is one during a different season?

im in MTV this summer too! what team are you working on?
From what I've heard, that music company in Atlanta is pushing HARD to expand. This summer is also the first summer they're hosting interns there. That's also very good pay.
I know exactly how you're feeling...went through a very tough internship search myself - lots of disappointments and near misses, a lot of Leetcode. Managed to pull through, but man it was stressful. I'm already dreading the full time job grind as well haha. Congrats, glad it turned out for you. 
>Flatiron Health

Thanks for posting. Salesforce seems very high in SF but I hear their SWE intern offers are pretty low for Indianapolis office. Any insight on this?

Hi Congrats. Interning for PM with Meraki. Do you happen to have any insights?
Is it for school credit?  In California, I'm pretty sure its illegal not to pay interns unless you offer school credit.
Get your experience dammit. No shame in taking unpaid to start off. 
Was your salary monthly on the letter? I got AMEX in Phoenix and I don't remember getting a monthly salary amount. Mine was $75,000 prorated for the internship. 
Goldman Sachs?
Congratssssss Plaid is so dope ugh I wish I got an offer from them. Do you mind me asking if you had to do the take home and if so what you did to pass it? I failed after that step but I’d really like to know what a passing solution would be like so I can hopefully not fail at that step again. 
is the google offer 12K bonus before or after tax?

Hey man! I'm headed to Amazon Toronto too.

Do you get the housing stipend even if you don't relocate?
> Relocation/Housing Stipend: $2000 one off relocation on first paycheck

When they visited my uni they said they'd stopped this. Must have misspoke. 

I found $2000AUD for 3 months housing in Sydney to be pretty shit tbh. It ended up being less than half my rent-spend, and I wasn't living glamourously. 
Shopify? My friend is going to be in Shopify Montreal. Around the same salary.
I met AWS at the career fair and interviewed the next day after handing them my resume. After that I had to take some tests and after passing all of those I had around 2-3 more interviews 
I'm lucky to get an interview forsure. It was around late Fall semester. Thank you!
from what i understand, around last summer Lyft made waves on here by hugely stepping up their comp packages for interns and new grads. *especially* returning intern -> new grad offers. something like 205k-225k all-in for returnings out of college... significantly above any other firm for new grad offers.

this was a surprise as that summer because intern comp back then was "normal" but then they came out of nowhere with huge return offers. 

before then, i think lyft was seen not quite on the same level of prestige as uber, airbnb, f, g, etc. news spread about the return comp and then suddenly lyft internships became more desirable and people were turning down fb/g to take an internship at lyft because they know the return offer is insane.

i think on top of this they just upped the comp on the intern as well. so now all of a sudden lyft is an elite destination for cs undergrads. honestly a brilliant move by lyft. i'm sure they were counting on communities like this to spread the info. i'm out of school now but i sure would have difficulty turning down an internship from lyft.
Lol I just checked my dates. I think it's actually 11 weeks.
Sure

Thanks! I got a university recruiter's e-mail through a friend who was going through the process back in October. And no, Pinterest matches interns to teams a month before their internship. They do send out a survey and have a lot of teams available, though. :)

Out of curiosity, what do you find “challenging and exciting” at Okta?

I have never heard of okra before this so I had to look them up. They are basically an IdP service. There are a plethora of identity management companies that I can recall off the top of my head, so I am not sure what makes okta stand out. In terms of identity management, I worked briefly on a team that handles this internally (SAML integration with third party) and was a bit bored with it. The patterns for this are extremely well known and documented and not much is done outside of that.

I think that's standard for a returning intern.
The Google internship is right now during the winter, and the Bloomberg internship will be this summer.

Congrats on the internship! I'm on the Android Location Research team.
Do you think it’s a better place to start a career than salesforce ?
Thanks so much. I looked through your history and you did great! You should be really proud. Lol I don’t think anyone understands how big of a disappointment I was this season but at least I’ve learned the game! Hopefully I can blaze through new grad recruitment and get exactly what I want! 
Yeah I heard that too but they cover housing and the COL is a lot lower so it might reduce the gap a bit. I don’t think it’ll be as much as sf still but that gives some reason as to why it’s like that. It’s like $20+/hr but I haven’t seen a recent offer so idk. Check Glassdoor! 
Thankss so muchhh. I’m super relieved. Maybe too relieved in fact loool. Just so happy to have options. 
Yeah sure pm me
Post tax
It covers 16 weeks instead of the normal 12 or so, and the amount they offer is post tax. After accounting for taxes (to make it comparable to stipends offered at other companies) it comes out to $16,400.

&#x200B;
Lol knew i should've made an alt

&#x200B;

Thought you were /u/GooseSquad
Yes! I forget what the interview consisted of exactly, but it was relatively simple compared to the SWE one.
Thanks, yeah I'm excited
Edit: sorry misread your comment.

I'm not sure I have any insights. There hasnt been a whole lot of info thrown my way.
I just divided by 12. I'm assuming they are setting up for return offers as they had many more interns this summer. From that they are offering salaries based on CoL, so NYC was $90k prorated.

From what I hear AMEX isn't very flexible about new grad comp (salary or stock)... I wouldn't expect their total comp offer to be over $100k.
yep! 
Before tax. It'll probably come out to 7-8 afterwards. Decent housing is like 1.5k-2k per month.
/r/UCI represent :)) 
Nope, it's Vanguard
If I had the recommendation letters I totally would! I'm a physics major / CS minor so an internship there would be a dream. I'm hoping after this one, next summer I'll be able to get one at ORNL!
Flying
I had it at the top of my location preference list. They originally gave me seattle, but I emailed them asking why I didn’t get anything on my preference list, then they updated to Austin. I also was offered late December 
Slovenia
"Placement Analyst"... full time is £50k
I think it really depends on the role/department you are applying for. I had 2 rounds of interview (1 technical with the department head I was gonna work for, 1 behavioral with their general HR ppl). The technical was not really that bad, mostly asking about the projects I have done (why I make this engineering decision/do that optimization blah blah), basic knowledge of the tech stack I will be using for the role (for example, I need heavy JS for the intern role and they asked me about stuff like concept of closure, async etc.). They seem to also like ppl who know their techs and products/IPs. I was interviewing for their entertainment group (gaming, media), and one question I thought was interesting was when the head asked me what games do I play and what I liked about them, and I so happened to be obsessed with a game that Tencent recently purchased and I know that their dept. is working on (Path of Exile), I was able to bring that up and gave my opinion as a gamer playing on the international server on what I could bring to their dept. team. For behavioral, it's just the usual communication, culture stuff. I didn't really consider other location options besides shenzhen since I am from HK and I live close to their HQ, and I am on OPT, so I don't want to take away time from the POST-opt lol. But they also have US HQ, and since they are coming to your uni (I am assuming US), I don't see why they won't be recruiting for their US HQ. Hope this helps :D
Yea it's less than minimum wage in US standard, but gotta take what I could get for an internship ;)

Edit: I think the experience was well worth having a less than US minimum wage. I got the opportunity to work at one of the biggest software companies in the world, I got out of my comfort zone of working in an English environment and really test my skills of dealing with stressful situations, I learnt the difference in dev culture and how two different cultures choose to tackle a problem. Honestly I would go again even if I were unpaid. :D
Yeah! Surprised as well. New grad is around 100k+ I believe
Just got my offer for Vancouver, can confirm that it's the same
Hey! Me too. Dope! What school do you go to?
For interns yes. You get it regardless
[deleted]
interesting, wonder how much the IPO affected that
Nice, this will be great for your career and it's nice that 2 of the companies were able to accommodate off-season internships
Are you doing them as part of co-op?

I'm thinking about doing the same but I wasn't sure how easy it would be to convince CECA to do 3 co-ops in a row.
Congrats on all of these, they all really seem great to work for!! For Cruise, are you planning on doing it in the fall/spring?

&#x200B;

Also, I don't think I've ever directly emailed a recruiter... did you get Cruise's contact info at a career fair? I'm curious how people at other colleges (especially those with a co-op program like waterloo) do this, since I go to a school that doesn't have that type of program and it feels like we have to figure stuff like that out ourselves if we want to.
That would have been really nice. At this point I'm just going to assume they won't give it to me, or else I'll just be stressing lol. Would have been really nice to do both, but couldn't risk my other offer
Yeah ive been programming since the 8th grade too but I decided to be retarded instead of really do something with it. Am now suffering the consequences.
ahhh okay. Have you also being applying for graduate positions?
Ran through every big name you can think off before finally landing offers haha, very rough season. Yeah I just decided today! Joining salesforce under mulesoft :)).
Does this let you see their emails?

I've been messaging recruiters on LinkedIn itself but they rarely reply. I think email would work better.
Not really, but you'll probably save more money in Atlanta lol. 
Thanks! I am definitely happy - it just came down to the wire lol, got my offers in late December / early January, after grinding since August (and grinding Leetcode since June). I think it will be easier for us next round at least; getting companies' attention will be much easier, just have to crush those algos. Good luck!
thanks for the reply. You are right. It's just shocking that the hourly comp almost doubles even with lower COL in Indy coupled with the fact that both interns in the 2 locations get corporate housing
Also is the 6K lump sum for Salesforce before or after tax?
The largest housing stipend I’ve ever seen is google nyc and it’s 12k for 3 months. You’re doing an extra month but that’s still a shit ton, especially post tax. I got an offer from salesforce and also accepted but they only gave $6k to us for 12 week internships or corporate housing. 

Btw what do you mean to make it comparable to other companies? That’s like 3x what big N’s offer for housing looool. Salesforce showed out.
How did you prepare for the program manager interview if you don’t mind sharing?  Did you have side projects etc? 

I’m really interested in applying for a similar position too, any information helps! Also is it okay if I dm you?

Also congratulations!!
Team?
OK.
Waterloo. You?
Yeah that's what I reckon is shit. They should up it to 6k and try cover fully cover housing. It's not really much from their perspective.

I think it comes to around the same tbh accounting for everything. And if I can get my salary taxed with my state tax as opposed to Cali tax(which I’ve heard some people do) it should be same or only a bit less. I’m more concerned about career growth and return offers though. 
Yes and I couldn’t be happier tbh. Luckily I made a good relationship with my recruiters so I think they’d be happy to reinterview me with an internship under my belt. Just gotta grind algoss. Speaking of which, would you be down to like hold me accountable for doing leetcode like towards summer? When I had a buddy to work with it was super helpful to actually grind. 
Yeah Ik :( super sorry you got Indy. On the bright side though, you could easily get a return offer and it’s very very easy to transfer offices. 
I can’t remember tbh I can check my letter and see. 
To clarify, $16,400/$4,100 is pre-tax. I grossed up the post-tax amount (that Salesforce says in the offer) to get the $16,400 pre-tax amount. This was so it could be compared to what other companies offer pre-tax (ex. to compare it to Uber's $1000/month pre-tax). But yeah, stipend is definitely thicc
Most of my prior experience on the technical side was through side projects and one previous internship, and as for the management side, I'm involved in a lot of social justice organizing and nonprofit work. It's not immediately relevant to a TPM's daily duties, but preparing for interviews is largely about convincing the interviewer that any skills you have are not only transferable but will set you apart from the rest of the applicants (who may not have the same background).

&#x200B;

It was useful to read up on the specifics of the TPM role and interviewing process at the company you're applying to, since it varies across the industry. Interviewers are also impressed if you've done your research, are interested in the work they do (and really let them know!), and ask a lot of good questions. As for the technical portion, outside of the coding challenge they may also ask some more abstract questions to gauge how you think (for mine, they asked what would need to happen on the backend, generally, once someone uploaded a video on Youtube). 

&#x200B;

DM if you have questions/need some resources! It's been a while, and this is my first experience with a TPM-like role too, but I'd love to be helpful wherever I can.
why do you ask? are you interning at GS as well? 
Queen's! Looks like most of the Amazon Canada interns are from Waterloo tho 
Any reason you're choosing to do so many internships? Sounds like you would be able to land most jobs after you graduate. Is it just to explore the different companies?

All three are top tier tho, grats!
Oh I see. Interesting, I heard that Waterloo CS students do co-ops to graduate but I guess I was wrong. Thanks, and good luck on all these internships!
Hah, that would be nice to have lined up, but no. What I meant was that I accepted an offer for the summer and want a full time return offer from that company, so I didn’t want to mess with it by trying to push to the fall. The office I want has very limited availability so I’m not taking any chances 
Lmaooooo I deadass had a hunch that was you. Btw I’m gonna make a spreadsheet and got a lot more so we should deffs share. 
From what I've heard, Salesforce hires a LOT of their interns, to the point that they don't actively recruit and hire new grads anymore (returning interns take all the spots). The Atlanta company is a bit harder to predict, being a new office and all. I can't really speak to career growth as I'm in a similar position as you.

&#x200B;
Sure thing, I could probably use that as well. Just hit me up when you're ready to get serious and we can keep track
Ok thanks
Oh I see. Oh I’m just understanding that you did that for your personal comparison, not that salesforce offered you 4.1k a month to match up to the market standard. I’m still baffled they’re giving 4x what uber and the others are doing wow. See you this summer lol. 
Yeah, we PM'd before lol
Have you received your money from Graebel yet? I'm not sure when funds are supposed to be released.
[deleted]
I see. Thanks for your input though. I just don’t wanna be stuck doing boring stuff as my first job after grad. Hopefully that’s not the case. 
Dope! Will do. 
Nope not yet. Have they even emailed you yet?

My friend got his but he starts like a full month before I do so I get that. Maybe shoot them an email on Monday 
Likewise buddy:))

Meta note: could future threads include a part about converting weekly/biweekly/hourly compensation to monthly?

Using 52 wk/yr and 12 mo/yr, weekly and biweekly to monthly should multiply by 4.333 and 2.167 respectively. Likewise hourly -> monthly (assuming 40 hrs / wk) should multiply by 40 then 4.33.

Ex: Company A offers 7750 / mo while company B offers 48 / hr. 

Those that convert to monthly with 4.0 wk/mo value B's offer at 7680 / mo while ot should be ~8.3k / mo.

They had posted the internship on my school’s job board online. Usually our department chair will email out internships like this but they never did. I got lucky in seeing it and sent in my resume and cover letter. Got an interview a week or so later and was offered the position on the spot. No coding challenges although they did ask about my projects and the stuff i learned in school. I was a little bummed when i started because it seemed less technical than i was expecting but we pivoted a week in and I’m now working on a super cool project in Unity and my friends all lament that i got the perfect opportunity lol.

Went with #1 because I get to live at home instead of paying basically my entire salary towards rent and taxes in Sydney for an entire summer. From talking to people in my general network (as well as word of mouth) the 30$/hour is about where most offers from good/notable companies in the area are at. Unfortunately I have no idea what the offer for the only big4 in the area is (not sure if they even have an intern cohort this year anyways)

I'm also wondering this
I did the numbers a little while back, they're probably just out of date. Another thing to add to the modprojects list.

edit: I've added it to the list! Whew, glad the hard part is over. Is this what it's like being a PM?

great salary given the COL

Would you be willing to share who the startup in Japan is? I've been looking specifically for internships in NLP or similar in Japan, but haven't managed to find many.
What's your experience in NLP? Like just some undergrad courses or have you built side projects or things like that?
I don't get it, 350K INR/mo sounds extremely high even if not an intern.
Did you negotiate that high at Riot? I've never heard of them normally paying that much
Well fuck my life
Damn, congrats! What do you plan on going with?
Lyft sounds like a ton of fun!
CONGRATSSSS. 

Gonna go cry about failing lyft again now ☺️
holy shit i make $10 an hour at mine lmao 
Wow that's pretty crazy that airbnb gives you 4000 a MONTH per housing... You could find great housing for like $1700 and pocket the rest...
Does Lyft let you do overtime *without* manager approval? If not, I wouldn't get my hopes high with the $78/hour because they'll likely say no if its with approval.
Hey I’m going to Airbnb too!  Are you in the Airterns FB group?
Was this thru career fairs, referrals, just applying online, etc?
Had you used MongoDB before applying?
[deleted]
wow nice job dude!! epic!
Damn that's nice! Does anyone know what the corporate housing Bloomberg offers for interns is like?

This GitHub comp is insane omggg. 
woah tesla has such low salaries?
What is the interview process like for Walmart?
Congrats! Can I ask if LinkedIn and Uber were just through online applications?
Why did you pick Uber over fb? 
What’s your profile like? 
The FB stipend I believe is now 1.6K/mo post tax.
[deleted]
Curious, are you a grad student, or did you negotiate your Stripe offer, or did you calculate "monthly" as meaning something other than four weeks? My offer was $4000 biweekly ($8000/month), which seems standard with other intern offers of theirs I've seen. I've heard Stripe doesn't really negotiate much even for new grads, but that could just be hearsay.
How are you doing a 12 week fall internship if still in school. My bad if this is a dumb question?
Did Goldman react differently in interviews to you having interned at their biggest competitor?
Are you saying you're a sophomore, but applied as a junior on your application? 
Also got Googs for NYC. What team are you working on? Hype to see you there.

EDIT: 

Did you also negotiate you housing stipend? I'm also doing 14 weeks and wondering if I can ask to increase the housing stipend to cover 4 months instead of just the 3 that 12 weeks would cover.
How did you get NYC for Google? I've heard it's basically impossible for interns to go there. Nonetheless, congrats! 
Are you canadian? Was it hard to get an internship in the US? (You would need to be sponsored for a visa I guess?)  I’m at UdeM (maybe I have no chance of a US internship since it’s not as well known as McGill) and I’m wondering if US internship are worth looking into. 
FB offered you NYC? Were you also a returning intern?
How did you get a signing bonus for an internship ? I thought those were only for ft offers
Can I DM you about flexport process?
Grats on all this! Worked with a couple people from Snowflake this summer when I was setting up their platform for use at the company I was interning at, awesome people!
which one did you take? flexport?
Did jpmorgan always pay that much?
This sounds very abnormal. 
I thought my intern salary was pretty decent, and 2sig is twice that lmao
Were these all from online apps? (except for 2s)
Also that offer from 2s is actually insane. Congrats man.
I want to be you
do you leetcode your entire life away and never go out by any chance? or are you a girl?
$12500/mo and $2100/mo for housing... holy fuck man
That's a great offer, Congratulations! How were the interviews at JS? How would you recommend one to prepare for them?
Congrats on the offer!
Did you have prior experience/projects in finance that made you stand out for JS? I was hoping to at least get an assessment but unfortunately my online app was immediately screened out :(.
Did you go from Facebook to Citadel, or the other way around?
/u/22SAS I found your new reddit profile :)
@GS strats? Is that non-tech?
Honest question, if this is a salary sharing thread what's the point of posting google if you dont have a salary yet
Hey congrats! Did you apply through the online portal for all of them? 
[deleted]
Which one are you taking?
So cool to see a fellow Rutgers sophomore!! Congrats! That’s an amazing offer (:
did you end up getting the offer from the SHE SWE MEET? or just by applying online?
Also another RU Soph- congrats!! Love to see it
congratz! being an intern at fb sounds awesome

What kinds of competitive programming did you do? ICPC? Code Jam? Codeforces? I’m just curious bcz i did theses too and didnt know too put them into my resume..
Is your Amazon offer a return offer?
Edit: didn't see the prior experience, nevermind.
pmed you about amazon internship. thank you!
May I ask how you ended up choosing?
Is this for summer 2019? When did you apply?
> Salary: $12 500 / month

Hoooly fucking shit that Jane Street offer is INSANE. I knew they payed well but good god.
Damn that's impressive man. Did you have any experience/projects in finance that you think might've made you stand out for JS?

What kind of grinding did you do? How long?
How did you get C1 in New York without interning for them before? Seemingly everyone from my school goes to TX or VA.
How did you apply to Snap?

Curious, which company in cambridge pays this high?

When did you interview and get your offer? I interviewed with AMEX and got an offer for Phoenix at the beginning of October. I would have taken it if it was NYC. 
How was the plaid interview process? They seem interesting, but I never got around to applying to them this semester

Also, congrats on all your offers!
How long did the Duolingo process take?

Hi, was just wondering the process for getting the option to pick between QR and SWE? Did you do your final round interview for SWE and then they allowed you to do QR because of prior experience (e.g math competitions) or did you do a QR final round? Thanks
Did you have to negotiate to get 8400/month? I’ve only send 8000/month for FB
Congratz on the offers.

I was just wondering, will you have to delay your graduation by accepting the 2 offers?

I'm in the same boat as well. I would love to be able to do both, however, I think I will have to delay my graduation.
can I see resume, thx
how many AP classes r you taking

Is portsmouth considered HCOL?
You're in the host matching process with Google now? I heard an offer isn't guaranteed at that point. 
>top 100 engineering school

Lol
I wouldn't be too happy about the overtime. From people I know who worked there nobody will let you do overtime at LinkedIn. Most people actually do undertime. It's a fairly chill culture so I wouldn't count overtime in my income if I were you. 
i don’t think you understand how overtime pay works  lmaoo
yeah, that never happens here. Not just for humblebrag reasons, but a small startup may make someone too easy to identify.
$95 / hour for a govt contractor? How?
Could you share how you negotiated offers? What wordings did you use? Means of communication? Any tactics?
Woah, someone else from ISU
Nice. I applied for that same position a month or two back and haven't heard anything hahaha. Congrats on the offer!
Nice! That's more than I make full-time in PA
Smooth sailing man :p
Isn't Norway a very high COL country? In that case, $30/hr seems to be too low, no? Is this the average over there?

hey, shot you a pm in regards to CIS!
when did you apply? I looked online like two weeks ago and could only find openings for their other offices. i even got an interview for their new jersey office. But it would've been nice to be able to just stay home at the burbs and not pay rent (I live in the Chicagoland area as well).
Hey I applied for the BofA tech analyst too! Haven’t heard anything back yet, so it might be a dull summer. Congrats to you though!

What was your Exxon interview like? I've seen them come to my campus before but I never really considered that they would have SWE positions.
Virtu is a top player in the industry but I'd stray away. I met a few interns from this past summer at superdays and they all told me they hated it. Very uptight culture, siloed teams, lack of communication. Just a fair warning. If I were you I'd probably take AirBnB, and if you're really interested in switching to trading for the increased upside, I'd rerecruit next year to try and land Two Sigma/Jump/Citadel/Citadel Securities.
Im quite confused,ehat constitutes as eastern europe? There is a big part thats like...central europe and then theres southern europe o.O

I also received the same offer as a local Vancouverite. No Housing / Relocation was provided. (Just another data point for local applicants). $450 lump sum for transportation :( 
Are you from Simon Fraser?
Is this for next summer or winter? I've been looking at Shopify and don't see any postings as of a few days ago
>Shopify was for winter, SurveyMonkey for summer. Shopify should start recruiting for the summer later this month!

Will this be for your first co-op/internship experience? Do do you have prior work experience? 
which big4 is in AU?
[deleted]
I just signed with them! Would love to connect.
Only the people with super high salaries are posting and making the younger people feel like shit. My internships paid me $15/hour and I was okay with that because it put cash in my pocket for college.
In between? Japanese-born foreigner. The fact that I speak both Japanese and English natively definitely helped out a lot.
Check out Honda Research Institute, although I'm not sure what they have going on right now.
Not the poster, but based on location, salary, and NLP, this was probably at Atilika:


https://www.atilika.com/en/careers/
This is the first year they haven't allowed salary negotiation actually! So to offset the lack of negotiation, they're paying everyone a flat 9k instead, so I'm not complaining.
Thanks! I'm doing both (summer and fall) lol.
Thanks man, dw about it it's kinda random tbh the questions you get and how you vibe with your interviewer.
Great housing in SF for $1700? Lol, you are not being serious. Unless he shares with a roommate and even then you'd need to split like $2000 for a really decent place.
[deleted]
I'm not sure but yeah you're probably right. I'd assume manager approval is needed lol.
Yoo congrats! I'm not yet my recruiter is going to follow up with all of that info lol. See you this summer!
Airbnb was just through applying online. For Lyft a recruiter reached out to me telling me to apply (don't remember how they got ahold of my contact info).
Yes, as the database for a React Native app. But I don't think it mattered as much.
Yeah, one of the highest I've seen for SF which is super helpful
I'm pretty sure they said it was housing downtown only a few blocks from the office, so it must be fairly nice. You share an apartment with others but you have your own room if I recall correctly.
Ohio State does as well but we aren't usually included in the "top schools"
Uc san diego as well
UCLA has a CSE program as well, although it's for CS and Eng
Hi am from Waterloo, we don't have or call anything 'cse' what are you talking about? 
[deleted]
Low? This is an internship. Anything above 200 bucks a month is a lot. 5k is just as much as people with proper jobs make who aren't still in school like interns. You even get a bloody relocation fee ffs! These are some sick internships. 
Varies a lot between the orgs. The org that I interviewed with had:
1 coding challenge, 1 technical interview, 1 interview with the engineering manager and 1 final call with the director.

Also, if you're interviewing with Walmart Technology (separate from Walmart Labs), then the process might be completely different. 
LinkedIn yes. Uber no. 
I felt Uber is really disruptive and a lot of the work there is product-focused. Got a chance to visit the HQ last summer and speak to engineers who are working on a lot of exciting stuff like UberFreight, UberEverything etc.  

FB is a great, comfortable company. But my thought process was -  5 years from now, Uber will be a totally different company, but FB will still be somewhat the same.

Junior at a no-name state school in the southern US. 2 previous internships, one at Walmart Labs and other at a small startup. 3.7 GPA (mostly because my school is famous for being shit easy). 

Did tones and tones of side-projects and hackathons. Hackathons are a great place to network and meet smart people who go to top schools and have sexy internships.
good
Is it really?? I really don't know, so I'm not sure if I could count on the 1.6k while i'm looking for housing :/
Non tech
$4000 biweekly != $8000 per month. For IRS accounting standards, there are 13 weeks in every 3 months. So (4000/2) \* 13 / 3 ≈ $8666
He'll take a semester off probably
Yeah, taking the semester off. The offer was for the summer but I asked my recruiter if I could do it in the fall and they were really chill about it
Lol not really. When I interned at JP, the interns and I joked around that the quickest way to get promoted at JP is to get a job at Goldman and come back to JP. There is a lot of hopping back and forth between those two companies.
Lol I would guess they reacted positively
I am a sophomore planning on graduating a year early. So my expected graduation date made me a "junior". For Google I applied as a sophomore to both EP and regular, thinking that I would be able to get EP. Ended up getting the regular SWE internship.
Niceee. I did not negotiate it. I think Google gives 12k for NY and 9k everywhere else. I figure the extra 2 weeks of salary they give you makes it not matter? Dunno
It's not impossible. If you get host matched to a team in NYC, you go there. NYC is Google's second biggest office!
Yeah you get put into host matching after you pass the interview. I put NYC as one of my preferred locations and got lucky to get a match there. Since NYC is Google's second biggest office, they actually have a lot of interns go there. Thank you!
I don’t think US recruiters really know McGill either. I’m Canadian! You should definitely go for it because Canadians can get J-1 visas, which are easy to get.
No, my recruiter put a bid in for NYC and told me I’d find out later.

EDIT: Are you doing Facebook NYC in the fall?
I think it's a Bloomberg thing, to be given on the first paycheque to cover relocation costs.
sure
They bumped up this year to be more competitive
Like the guy above said, they are trying to step up to compete with the big tech companies. My buddy interned there two years ago and it was much lower.
online for all, but the recruiter for DRW knew me
I've never touched leetcode in my life and I'm a white dude so no.
someone's jealous lmfao
Prop trading/hedge fund salaries at places like Jane Street, Two Sigma, Citadel are all insane 
Fuuuuck. That's like what I make in 2 months.

It hurts.

Was picking between FB and Citadel for this summer (senior summer before masters year), ended up choosing Citadel.
Lol, you got me thala :)

I'm a CS major at RU as well - congrats on the offer! I was at FB NYC over the summer (May-August '18); let me know if you have any questions :) 
Just by applying online. :D
I started CP back in high school, mainly to get to the IOI (which didn't end up happening). I stuck with it and did a lot of Codeforces contests. I also participated in the ICPC and Code Jam, but didn't get to the finals of either (because they're ridiculously hard to get to (: ).

I had a link to my Codeforces profile on my resume, and some experience I had with setting + testing problems for contests.
My return offer was $7850 if you were curious
late september 
Rumor is that Capital One's NYC office is mostly reserved for prestigious private university students and high performing return interns from normal schools.
I just told them I wanted to be in New York. Eventually got another offer in New York and they moved me after I told them that.
Snap is ~~impossible~~ hard to get into if you can't get a referral or meet them at a conference. 
Referral
Thanks man!
Hi, I chose to go with Riot, been a huge fan of league for a while now. CZI definitely impressed me with their team and mission though, I'll be looking out for them for full time roles. 
I applied online and went through the standard interview process
same offer from them too. They also gave a $5000 scholarship offer.
Two Sigma and Citadel.
If you're interested to discuss comp you can reach out to me via PM. I know the comp at almost all reputable Chicago shops (from friends who are also doing trading)
I messed up, sorry..
I ended up only do Airbnb for the summer because I don't want to work over the fall semester
Most of them don't actually. Facebook recruiter contacted me through Linkedin and my school has a good relationship with Microsoft. The Airbnb interview is through Grace Hopper
Taking Yext. I really want to try living in NY, it's been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember. 

I have the option to take Asana in a different term that I'm debating over. Yes, but I heard it's not super well set up yet. Basically a remote job.
Yes
I interviewed late September, got the offer 3 hours after my interview. 
I interviewed in late September and got the offer an hour after, however I specified that I was only looking for positions in the NYC metro area.
I interviewed at a conference and got the verbal offer right at the end of my last interview lol
compensation for internships doesn’t really matter after a certain point. What’s a few thousand dollars now if you stand to propel your career further at a more prestigious company? 
Most likely OP values the project, experience, networking opportunities, or name enough to pick it over a few grand
[deleted]
I think the above poster is a grad student.
In my case, I came into college with 15 credits' (one semester's) worth of AP courses that I can count towards my graduation requirements, so with a somewhat heavier courseload over the next couple semesters (18 credits per term), I'll either graduate on time or be within one summer course's worth of graduating on time (in that case I'd graduate in July or so rather than May).

In any case, from what I've heard, doing double internships is fairly common in CS, so if you think the two are different enough that it'd be helpful to do both instead of just one (i.e. you're not doing Google for the summer and Facebook for the fall or something like that) it'd be worth it, imo, even if you have to delay your graduation - lots of people graduate in both spring and fall, and companies are hiring year round, so if you're not risking losing financial aid, I don't think there's too much to worry about. Of course there are a lot of factor to consider, but I wouldn't say you should totally disqualify the idea even if it were to delay your graduation unless you'd be losing out on scholarship money or something.

That said, I'm just a student, so take that as you will!
I wasn't sure, but using the website linked it's higher than Boston because of housing so I guess... from what I've seen the apartments are cheaper but actually buying a house in that area is very expensive.
[deleted]
Okay thanks for the info
explain please
They could post without the name and instead something like "20-50 people startup"
I know him personally – the contractor is a small company and only hires a handful of engineers. He also is extremely talented at kernel programming.
Believe it or not, The Art of the Deal provided great insight to this. Since it wasn't written by Trump itself but by Tony Schwartz, I was able to understand how to sell myself in interviews and also negotiate thereafter. 
Well, no.  I just meant a state school in Illinois haha.
Thanks!

If you haven't tried NISC, I'd give them a shot.  They made me an offer at $18 earlier this year, I just turned it down because the drive was hell, the offer was for front-end, and I'm not super excited to do front-end if I don't have to.

But, the people were super nice, and the campus was also pretty sick, so I wouldn't pass them up if you're hard up.
Same to you. :P
Intern wages rarely exceed $30/hour. Effective CoL in Oslo is 79 % SF CoL, with cheaper rent and more expensive everything else.

I just checked the momentary NOK - USD exchange rate, and I'll actually be making $28.60/hour, not $30.00. However, with 2014 exchange rates, I would be making $44.40/hour.
What does pro rata mean ?
Yes pro rata.
I see you're a man of ~~culture~~ *low wages* as well 
haha almost yeah. not saying this isn't a great country to live in but the salaries kill me.
Portugal is just overall unfriendly if you're keen on not being poor. I'm considering it.
Ho for sure. I've been applying to Switzerland, UK and Luxembourg (some Netherlands too) but so for no luck. I've had 4 interviews but they all ended up with me getting ghosted.

I mean, you can live with this kind of salary in portugal but for comparison, my friend with no degree and doing a low level job (think replenishing shelf's in a store) is getting paid the same as I am.

Good lord, that's what I got in 4 months a tiny startup.
Right? Fuck outta here with 10k+ a month 
It's comforting to see this. Makes me feel better about my "measly" $20/hr. It's a great salary from a young college graduate just getting into a professional field, but seeing all these things at like 2-3x that amount is daunting. 
Thanks for the catch, it was late when I posted it and typo'd. See you this summer!
Yearly salary, but only paid for the 10-13 weeks I'm working.
Prorated means adjusted for time, so adjusted for the year in this case

My guess is Viasat
Yes, but not that side.
I met them at my college's career fair on September 18th, and they got back to me to schedule an on-campus interview on September 21st. The entire hiring process took about a month and a half, as I got my written offer on November 1st.
thanks! I got very lucky and had an on site around mid november. Their application ended in end of november, but I know another friend of mine who got an offer last week. I applied around mid October. I hope that info helps you in the future! 
citadel itself isn't a prop trading firm, so no
My intern interview was an hour long behavioral interview on campus, I got my offer ~2 weeks after the interview. New grad roles had the same on-campus interview, but then had an onsite that I was technical from what I understand.
Not garage, just a SWE internship. Strange that the offer is so much lower for locals :\\
University of Alberta
Shopify was for winter, SurveyMonkey for summer. Shopify should start recruiting for the summer later this month!
I have one past internship at a good Canadian tech company
At this point, the only one without an office afaik is FB. Google has a big office in Sydney, Amazon have a few and Microsoft now has one in Sydney iirc. The only one that has a significant intern program is Google
I mean you're not wrong, but it also kinda pushes us that make less currently to be looking into pushing our luck when negotiating our intern salaries.
>Japanese-born foreigner.

There's no such thing. If you are born in Japan you are Japanese.
I thought as much too - I applied to them a month ago but they never got back to me, so I was hoping there would be other companies too. Thanks for the link, nonetheless! 
Dang, that sounds awesome, have fun!
dayum
Did you get an offer for the fall or did you move one over? 
Yeah I agree. My mock interviewer loved me and the others were indifferent even though I made them laugh a bit.
My housing in SF is $1650, which I thought was fairly average among my friends. Definitely feasible 
Yeah of course you need to live with a roommate no shit. Why would a 21 year old intern need a full apartment to themselves? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
Yeah I'm from the bay area. 

You can get a 3 bedroom house in palo alto for $4k a month. 

My brother rents a room 2 blocks from alamo square in a nice victorian house for $1700. 

  


So it makes sense that op edited to clarify they meant $4k for the whole summer. 
You should ask. Cause companies get stingy with stuff like this. Its like "unlimited PTO," which we all know means nothing.

I'm interning for Uber soon, and we were told 10 hours without manager approval and over that requires approval. Some people told me managers would interfere even with the 10 hours that are without approval so you can see how it turns out.

Nice offers though! Congrats :)
That’s awesome, congrats!! I’m a sophomore going through the process. I have one offer in hand with a well-known non-Big N tech company. I’m still recruiting throughout the next semester, but I feel safer with something in hand.

However, your offers are goals for me next year. Do you have any tips for preparing for interviews and getting interview offers for these companies? Or maybe resume advice? Thank you so much!
is it not at the 92y anymore?
Davis is called CSE as well, but they're not anywhere close to top 10 lol.
Seattle
I've been doing it wrong this whole time. I should pay my landlord and student loans in passion
>Tesla wants people who are in it for passion and not the money

/r/HailCorporate /s

I hope their work life balance and benefits make up for it. If not, then it sounds like they want people to work their asses off for little because of "passion". I've heard similar things about SpaceX. 
whynotboth.gif
The Tesla return salary is pretty garbage too. It's about 38.
How can you live on $200 a month? What are you talking about? 
It's low when you are competing for talent and know that companies next door are paying almost double...
Let's not forget that the internships are in Cali, and the cost and standard of living is that much higher. I cannot attest to it though as I'm east coast. 
nah not compared to other comparable companies. if you're good enough to get in at tesla, you're good enough to be fielding offers dramatically higher. 
Thx
Yup.
Oh wow I see. Weird question, but would you say it's beneficial to say your a junior VS sophomore or does that have no bearing? 
Thanks for the info! Intern salaries in the US are so high, it’s kinda crazy. Also, working at one of those companies must be a great opportunity to learn a lot! 
Not in Columbus, interestingly
Doesn't surprise me. Goldman pays a hair more than that. 
[deleted]
can i ask how u consistently do well on tough technical interviews? I havent seen someone get an offer from 2sig, drw and jane street before. do you just leetcode alot, or do u do competitive programming? thanks!
[deleted]
lol last year I made half of that the whole summer 
That’s what I’ve made in my entire life... college freshman btw
6k per month is really fucking good too
Well who would say no to 12k a month, that’s unbelievable... I’ll be following the new grad salaries as for prop trading as the threads pop up
fellow tamils? or am I wrong?
I'm interested in chase if that was just and online portal sort of thing. Also congrats! 
[deleted]
Sup Ryan
My situation is kinda like you. Tried to get to the IOI but didnt get too. I also tried ICPC but it was so hard too idk why lol. But my biggest problem is in the interview, I didnt manage to talk out loud while trying to solve the problem bcz when doing competitive programming, i usually stay silent to focus on the problem. Do you feel the same?
So they moved you after you showed them another NY offer? I've heard of others doing that on here. 
Ur right on the first one being Citadel, don't think 2s is the second one tho
You're quite bad at guessing.
I see, that makes sense. Congrats on the offer and enjoy NY!
[deleted]
That makes sense. I told them (as I tell everyone) that I was open with location. Wouldn't surprise me if few people got Phoenix. And one hour later? My letter was dated for the day after my interview (and I found out a week later), but they decide that quickly? 
Wow, I didn't realize how flexible they were – will have to keep that in mind the next time I interview. Best of luck this summer!
See...this is my problem with Google's process. You **HAVE** to say no to other offers or be ready to renege to get a chance at Google. Few companies pull shit like that. That's a soapbox for another thread though. 
the monthly figure you measured assumed a hourly rate of ~$75/hour for the full 40 of a work week. That doesn’t make sense considering your hourly rate is $50, making your overtime rate $75/ hour.

your monthly pay is around 50x40x4, which is $8,000/mo. for your estimate to be correct, you would need to have worked 51 more hours per month, and I do not think that is very feasible. Correct me if I’m wrong and this was your intention. 
Thanks for the resource -- I will keep that in mind
Ah, okay. Didn't know SF is even more CoL area. I had heard from my European friends from several countries that they really struggle with money when they visit Norway due to everything being so expensive.
First result when you Google it
Since you're a throwaway can you say what uni?
$18k/month for internship in London??? Did I get it wrong somehow?
There must be something. Sure you don't go to a target school but is your gpa very high for instance? Or you just practice programming alot and it is your passion?
[deleted]
Congrats, must've been tough.
What kind of GPA did you graduate with? Also, any extracurricular things you did, or previous work that might have helped you in the application process?
reply with a fire emoji if it is Citadel
[deleted]
Sounds good, I'll keep an eye out, thanks!
Looking at some of these, I'm wondering if I can go back to being an intern.
Yeah, unless you're out on the west, you're not going to be making these $50/h salaries. 
That's now how it works here but I'm glad at least someone feels that way.
Oh nah both were for summer and I moved one to fall. Both are actually pretty flexible I think with moving around your start date.
Because you don't know anybody in sf and don't want to risk rooming with a fucking psycho 

I'm all for saving money but if I'm making 50/hour plus a stipend I'll happily pay 2-2.5k to live by myself 
nobody needs a full apartment by themselves but my quality of life is incredibly different with a roommate vs without regardless of how good of roommates they are. 
No it's 4000/mo, not total. Post tax that should be around 2800, which is still a lot, but with SF rent prices so high I think a large part will still be going towards rent.
Thanks, you too! Honestly the only thing I do is prep leetcode lol. I thought CTCI was useless since it was mostly stuff I already knew and I couldn't check my solutions. A lot of people say to not spam the compile/run button on leetcode since most of your interviews are whiteboard, but for Airbnb and Lyft, they expect runnable code in coderpad, and will either paste in testing code or have you come up with testing code yourself. 

If you're at a target school, then going to their tech talks on campus or if they're at your school hackathon then that's a good place to hand in your resume. Be sure to apply online as well no more than 2 weeks within the time they open apps. Unicorns fill up way more quickly than FB/GOOG/MSFT/AMZN since they have few spots and a lot of people applying.

I know this is gunna suck but try doing leetcode regularly over the summer, and ramp up significantly towards end of july/august. GL.
I don't know where it is exactly, so maybe it's that?
On Discovery Day a recruiter told me housing is going to be at 92Y. 
UNDERRATED COMMENT OF THE YEAR. ALL OF YOU SWE SHOULD NOT LISTEN TO COMPANIES WHO TALK ABOUT PAYING YOU THROUGH YOUR PASSION. PASSION DOESN"T PAY BILLS
Or better yet, pay Tesla in pure passion instead of working software
It doesnt. They have notoriously bad wlb.
sounds like he lives at his parents house and thinks food is free 
You don't. Its an internship. Thats something you do next to your school to get your school done. After school you go to work and its not an internship.
lol
Yeah definitely. For a junior, they can convert you to full-time after your internship. For a sophomore, they need you to do another internship. Then again thats anecdotal evidence lol. The reason I applied as a sophomore to Google is because I was going for EP (specifically for sophomores). I figured if I got Google then I would not graduate early anymore if they cared about that. Ended up getting lucky and got the regular SWE internship is cool. 
No problem! And yes, I’m so grateful for the opportunity. If you need more information about the process feel free to message me. Always happy to help out a fellow Montrealer :) 
Can confirm, my offer was 47 as well
Also confirming. My recruiter initially gave me the $43/hr figure over the phone, but then when I received my offer letter, it said $47.
NY? I know Chicago offer is lower
Depends on what year you are. Sophmores get paid less than juniors
I didn't think the DRW interview was particularly hard after I was told I was allowed to Google stuff while doing it. The Microsoft interview was significantly easier than JS since it didn't involve any heavy math.

I haven't used leetcode ever, but I was USACO platinum in high school, did a lot of codeforces, and help train my school's ICPC team. I also used to train a lot of for math competitions in high school, but I'm kind of done with all that stuff now and only do Putnam now, but that helped a lot with JS. Sometimes you just get lucky though because I ended up getting railed by D.E Shaw.
[deleted]
I graduated 3 years ago though. Lol
He is, I am Punjabi! 
Facebook winter;

Google summer  if I get a good team, else LinkedIn summer
Ayyy, Sucal!! ;) 
Not really. I was used to whiteboarding to explain CP concepts, and that translated into interviews. Both the ICPC and the IOI are super hard and a lot of work. I still do ICPC prep for fun, but it’s not as much of a focus for me anymore.
Guess I wouldn't make a good quant.
Thanks! What are you taking? I just saw your offers, congrats on doing so well!
Yeah, I had the same impressions. My friends who worked there loved it as well. I'm most likely going to take it, I just need to think about it a little more. I'm debating whether I want to do another unicorn/startup internship or if I want to try the really big tech company experience and see if I enjoy that at all.
1 week 40 x 50 = 2000
overtime 10hrs a week 75 x 10 = 750
with overtime pay one week = 2000 + 750 = 2750
the average month has 4 weeks and some
2750 x 4 = 11,000/mo 
Your friends are right. As I said, rent is cheaper than SF, but everything else is more expensive. If they visited Norway *before* the oil crash in 2014, a pint of the cheapest beer in a pub would cost ~$13. A Big Mac would be ~$20.
University of Edinburgh!
I thought pro rata meant that I am going to get paid the salary of £42000 a year salary for the 3 months that I am working there. 
Defos not 18k lol.

So per month i will get paid £3500 per month before tax for 3 months + a one off £5000 housing bonus.
[deleted]
Good to know
In addition to Garage, MS Vancouver also has SWE positions at The Coalition (game studio for Gears of War) and for working on the hololens
Like he said the data is skewed heavily towards the people who are unicorns since most of them use this sub and would post on this thread. Majority of interns are not making 50/hr. Not even close to that.
Absolutely but now I know I can be pushing for mid-20's during salary negotiations.
Most Japanese people tend to be very ignorant, and in general do not understand the difference between nationality and race.

But that doesn't make them correct. Although rare, legally speaking there are white-Japanese people, black-Japanese people, and so on. Which means that Japanese-born foreigner doesn't make any sense.

The sooner you start calling yourself Japanese the sooner it will change.
Did you move Lyft to Fall? I had an offer from both and Airbnb didn't seem to be able to move so I went with them for the summer.
You can get a studio or airbnb for ~1500/mo. 2.5k is for a full one-bed apartment. 
Living alone when you're like 20 and single sounds boring and sad. Paying 2k a month just for rent for one person is ridiculous. I'd rather pocket that money. Money saved is money earned. 
Sure, but that's the difference between the housing being 'great' and 'unrealistic'.
Thanks, I'll probably message you when the semester ends :) 
So you were doing competitive programming in HS but eventually changed to competitive math in college? Can I ask what is your CF rating?
Oh really, how much do you usually work per week?
That was a reply to /u/YungSedditBoy. Your guesses were a bit closer. Two Sigma doesn't even hire trading interns, so he's way off.
[deleted]

[deleted]
Cool, congrats. Going to try for a grad job?
Having a really good GPA like that matters alot for internships. Some jobs even have GPA restrictions before you can apply. Bigger companies do tend to look at GPA in my experience.
My job isn't paying me anywhere close 50/hr so this hurts a bit. 
yeah sure, why not. Just think people should focus on getting an internship at the place they would like rather than the money involved. You'll make money later on.
Completely unrelated, but I just read this and just had to tell you that you are a star. I wish more people in Japan thought this way.
Oh dam, yeah I moved Lyft to fall. I had to let them know by a certain date if I wanted to move it since it's first come first serve so I'm assuming they filled up on fall slots when you tried maybe :(?
which neighbourhoods are these? I couldn't find any studio apartments for <2k a month with a full kitchen not in tender/soma/mission

I used airbnb, padpiper, and facebook groups (cause I don't wanna risk getting scammed on craigslist)
[deleted]
Well don't leave us hanging dog.
Haha, that's crazy. Your choices/order are what I would've gone with also. Have fun :)
[deleted]
I feel that. I've been counting down the days until my start date in Winter, I can't imaging waiting a year. Why do you have to wait so long? I thought you're taking Asana? Is that not for this summer?
Has already agreed to it
It won’t be that hard to get return full-time offer.
Honestly i’ll be using BB to interview at other companies / top tech startups.
If I don’t manage to get anything better then yeah will use BB as backup.
High GPA is more of a cut off measure but it’s rarely used as a qualification 
this sub is full of overachievers and the 1%, and I’m guilty of frequenting it myself lol. if you’re happy with where you are, then there’s no need to worry. also, keep in mind most interns are only employed for 3 months at most, so it’s easier for companies to throw a higher hourly rate since it’s not that costly in the big picture. 
You are the majority lol. Alot of people aren't going to post how much they make cause it doesn't seem interesting. Not sure if this is the objective of this thread but that's how I interpreted it. Like me getting paid 18/hr is not something I'd post on a Reddit compsci thread about salaries. But if I was getting paid 50/hr I might be more inclined to post. 
It's okay for people to do that, and also okay for them to get dollar signs in their eyes if that's what they want.
That might be it – thanks for letting me know and good luck this summer!
I'm super late to this thread but are you taking a quarter/semester off from school? Are you still graduating on time?
Okay, with those restrictions it's definitely a lot harder. Mission and soma are incredibly popular neighborhoods and most people get their tenants from craigslist.

You might be able to find something in the outer neighborhoods, though, like Dogpatch, Outer Mission, or Sunset/Richmond. At that point though it makes more sense to Bart in from Berkeley/Oakland because your commute is about the same. 

If you're looking at airbnb, why not get a private room and complain to your host/the company if your roommate is weird? In general someone paying 1000+/mo to live somewhere isn't very risky. 
I'd prefer not to reveal the companies as it would give away a lot. However, I will say the two companies are direct competitors to IMC and Jump.
I'm taking the semesters off school. I have advanced credits from my high school's IB program, so I'm not really delaying graduation too much. Hope that helped!
[deleted]
Sounds like a good position to be in, I start a comp sci degree next year, any tips from your experience to secure these kind of roles?
Lol yeah I'm taking fall quarter off to do the internship. I'm still graduating on time since I came into college with a bunch of credits from AP classes in high school.
Would complaining do anything? Like if my roommate is loud inside the house at 3am or doesn't clean anything I doubt the company or landlord would care 

Where do interns usually live if their office is in the mission or financial district? The place I'm going to be living in is excelsior/mission terrace area since tender/soma/mission has a very high concentration of crime according to trulias sf crime heatmap 

UIUC?
Crazy. Good job getting those offers! If you make a good impression, they'll want you back. Don't worry about logistics.
Grind CTCI and Leetcode have amazing side projects and compete in programming contests like Bloomberg Codecon and Google CodeJam and try and get referrals
The landlord is responsible for keeping common areas clean. Quiet is more of a gamble, but most landlords will help you because they want to avoid a bad review at all costs.

It's true that most of the crime occurs in mission/nob hill/soma/union square, but that's because that's where most of the people, bars, and activity are. The neighborhood you picked is basically a suburb, mostly single family homes. Depending on your exact location you may not even have public transport in walking distance.

I would say most interns want to live in walking distance of city life, which does mean that they are exposed to more crime. Nothing unreasonable if you obey basic safety, though. Ideal mix of fun and safety is, imo, anywhere north of California St and east of Van Ness Ave plus the Mission District. In SoMa, North and East of 4th Street is totally fine. 

Tenderloin has a lot of low income housing and is smelly and noisy so I wouldn't live there. Lower Nob Hill, Pac Heights, and Nob Hill are all fine, though, unless you plan to bring a car or something. The crime is because Polk street is the main bar hopping area aside from the Marina. 

Source, go to Berkeley and lived in the area all my life
Interesting, I never thought landlords would care because I'm used to shitty Toronto and Waterloo landlords that do fuck all since the demand for housing is so much higher than supply

Yea my place is pretty far from downtown and my office but total commute is still ~30 minutes (10 minute walk to BART and 20 minute ride) which is okay

I mostly err'ed on the side of caution when I was deciding where to live since this is the first time I'm living in SF so I don't actually know how good or bad it is. Also cause so many people warned me to stay the fuck away from Tenderloin and other aggressive homeless people stories

I read the mod note and am not trying to troll. If people find this useful by all means I won't stand in the way.

That being said, I feel like an intern's primary goal should be to make sure they're working somewhere that provides valuable experience. _That_ being said, I also think interns should be paid well, but it should take a back seat to how it the experience will position you in the future.

I was an intern for three years, and now interview intern candidates each year. When I looked for internships for myself, I looked for things like:

* Are interns embedded with the other software engineers (preferred), or working on another project on the side?
* Does the salary cover all of my living expenses plus a little extra?
* Will I get strong mentorship from an experienced engineer?
* Will the work be interesting, enjoyable, and challenging?
* Is there an opportunity to work part time after going back to school?

These are all way more important to your career than salary. Yet still, I interview some interns who will have multiple offers that will compare them more or less based on the salary. Like, $company is paying me $x, can you match that? Nothing terribly wrong with asking that question, but for many of them it's clear that the answer is a strong determinant of where they will chose to work, which I think is wrong.

I'm not sure what influence your school has on an internship offer? From my experience in the UK, this has very little (if any) influence on the offer you get. And while prior experience would increase your chance of an offer, again I haven't heard of that influencing, say, salary. Therefore, both pieces of info seem a little irrelevant. What's the justification?

> I read the mod note and am not trying to troll. If people find this useful by all means I won't stand in the way.

To be clear, your comment is totally fine. "Meta" discussion on salaries/offers here is generally acceptable (if it starts getting "distracting" we might take action, but I don't think that's likely). We don't actively encourage it in the OP because it's not the focus of the thread, but if people want to chime in that way, nothing wrong with that.

> That being said, I feel like an intern's primary goal should be to make sure they're working somewhere that provides valuable experience. That being said, I also think interns should be paid well, but it should take a back seat to how it the experience will position you in the future.

There's a couple things here. One is that I think salary is used as a metric for company desirability, and thus how prestigious a certain internship will look on a resume. The correlation there isn't perfect, but it's reasonably solid, and more importantly, money itself is a relatively objective, even transparent (sort of) metric. You can't say the same thing about the actual internship work experience, which is easy to twist and hard to verify.

The other thing is that it's hard to know how accurate a company's description of what the internship will be like actually is. There have been stories told here of people who got offers -- internships or otherwise -- and then the actual work they got was totally different, the culture was unexpected, etc. Whereas at least money is something a company is unlikely to blatantly lie about, plus to a certain extent people probably figure that the more a company is willing to pay interns, the more invested they are in those interns, the more they're taking internships seriously.
I get your point but the actual details of the work involved in the internship is known only after it begins. You can’t tell for sure if it will be challenging or you’ll have strong mentors. Hence why students assume good salary = all round good experience . Which may not be necessarily true.

Definitely affects you if you're aiming for a top company.. ergo a top salary
I have seen it really affects your job prospects in the US more than in Europe 
1. Top Polish uni/first year
2. Spring internship (although many peers had no experience before joining)
3. Cybersecurity
4. Intern
5. Major Polish city
6. 3 months
7. 3000 pln/month after tax (~$800/month) single room rent is around 900 pln for perspective
8. None

Generally speaking intern/cs career situation in Poland is really good, many companies are coming here (especially financial ones) so if you want an internship and are not a dumbass you'll get one. The pay is also high (and grows really fast), given that median pay in Poland is still really low - 2500pln/month. Mid/senior programmers can now easily get 120k pln/year (with absurdly low col) and it is constantly growing, so please come to Poland :)
Would you mind sharing how you got in contact with them I’ve been trying for months and my app hasn’t changed 😣
Wow thats fucking good for capital one.
do most mclean interns get that salary?
That's a pretty sweet offer, and any info on AU offers is much appreciated. The internship scene here isn't nearly as popular as the US though, so I can't say I'm surprised.

Out of interest, when did you go through the application process to already have the offer? I know they opened them a while back but I just applied a little over a week ago to the Software Dev stream
Shit, I got a hacker rank challenge like a month ago but never bothered doing it cause they're in Sydney and I'm in Melbourne. Didn't realise they would give a relocation bonus. Wonder if I can still do it. 
>Salary:  
>  
> $75,000AUD per/annum

Wow, A senior developer in my country makes $10,000 USD per/annum
Any idea how much they pay to their PM interns?
UBC I’m assuming?
School is most likely UBC
Hey, I go to sfu as well and was wondering if this is for coop?  Also, did you do anything special to prepare for this internship and what kind of advice would you give?

Would really appreciate getting an answer, thank you!
Arista? That's my guess

Akuna?
How many hours per week?
Just curious what's considered top 5 in Canada. Waterloo, u of t, what else? 
VMware is absolutely taking advantage of folks outside the US... 
38,400 AUD per annum, in Sydney? May I ask what your accommodation is like? If you're paying for it yourself, that must take a pretty chunk out of your paycheck.

Glad to hear you're enjoying it, though.
Co-Op?

How did you apply for the position?
What's the monthly and housing they're offering interns this summer? Last year I got $7650/month and a $7,000 housing stipend + transport etc.
Congrats, I was wondering how you interviewed so early in the year but it's Australia so that makes sense that it'd be Nov-Jan
Damn dude, that's pretty sick

I'm looking at everything in this thread and it seems like lots of people from top uni's are getting top jobs.

As a dude in a small no-name Midwestern university I'm wondering what ppl from my sort of background end up scoring
If only you were an intern for blizzard... that would be perfect with the username.
Do you know if they're already recruiting for next summer?
Virginia is HCOL?
Do you get a sign on bonus or other benefits for coming back for a second internship?
[deleted]
[deleted]
What period is the internship? Fall, Winter, summer? 
[deleted]
Ayy Palantir?
Databricks?
Wow the offers from Rubrik are that nice? Doesn't that make it just as good as a FB offer and even better than Google offers (at least raw salary wise)?

&#x200B;

Do you know what you're leaning towards for these? Also, were these return offers from previous internships or referrals or are they both recruiting for next summer already?
What did you have on your resume before you go noticed by them? Or did you go through referrals?
I just got an offer from them too. How hard was it to move it to the winter, and how many other interns were there during that time?
Why try to hide the company for an internship? This is clearly Amazon.
I'm not sure about money as a strong signifier of quality for an internship, though. I think the biggest reason for why I'm saying this is I know several larger, well paying companies (EPIC, for one) that puts interns in groups to put together some prototype. These projects are not much different from capstone class projects, and in my opinion they don't prepare interns nearly as well as embedded, mentoring positions where you get to see the gritty, less well defined world we all work in.

Money is definitely a moderately good signifier for a good internship, but it's _as_ important to ask the questions I bullet pointed.
Oh I totally get it. This is all for selfish reasons. I feel like you can better position yourself in your career (and get a better paying job out of school) if you can make experience and potential the prime motivating factor for an internship instead of total comp. Bottom line is internships last like 4 months. Even large differences in pay are not terribly significant in that amount of time, compared to the significance that fantastic experience brings to the table (if you have to choose). This really shouldn't be that controversial. I'm not advising anybody to accept jobs with terrible pay, just to not disregard offers that pay a great living wage plus a little extra.

Maybe this is just hard to hear. It really is hard to have a big juicy carrot dangled next to a normal looking one and choose the normal one. It can pay off though. Studies show that those who can delay reward have a higher earning potential. That is what I'm talking about here.

By the way, taking the smaller offer that offers the potential of part time work during school pays HUGE in the longer run. Honestly, that is one of my most important bullet points from my original list. 
What sort of work does that entail if you don't mind me asking?
While the hourly wage is fairly low you should go into internships more concerned with what you can learn.  I did an internship gig where I absolutely learned more on the job than I ever did in the classroom and that was at a boring insurance company making $14.50/hr.
#whoosh
How was the interview process?
Hey if you don’t mind me asking, how do you have an offer for JP Morgan so early?

I just finished the hirevue they sent me. Do they respond relatively quickly after you send in your hirevue?

Thanks!
Good to see another soul from Spokane here, are you doing the web development independently or working with a local company? I haven't found many internship opportunities in the home town.
Eugene area? We might be working right next to each other. 
Jesus, you made more than senior devs in my area.
3 weeks?  Is it a Winter internship program?  How did you find/apply to that?
> Capital One


I am hysterically laughing right now at how low Canadians are paid. Capital One in Canada pays US $16/hour for software engineering interns in Toronto which is high CoL. 

I know you!

Would you recommend bringing up your commute time in an interview to get extra $$ if it's super long?
Did you have to ask for the $1500 bonus for commute?

I got the same offer minus bonus and etc. Interview and such were not comped. I also live an hr away and was the same for other students I asked
Drexel?
How was the interview process?
wait what? Isn’t that below minimum wage?
[deleted]
can you please describe the interview process/questions?
I'm not sure. I think putting school and salary together makes a lot of assumptions.
Sure, it might affect you getting job offers, agreed, but this topic isn't about if you got an internship offer, but rather the details of the internship offer. Unless you mean the latter by your comment. Would my school, it's rank, influence my salary and benefits? Perhaps previous experience could influence the salary you get, but would that be the case with an internship?
Thanks for the insight! I don't know how much you'd know about this since this thread is about internships, but how would you say Polish companies' working conditions and cultures are? Are employees treated well, not too much overtime, etc?
I had a quick look at the website that you’ve linked to and it seems that there are indeed 120k job for devs in Poland, but they are all contracting jobs. The average for perms are lower, probably around 60-80k.
Krakow?
I don't really know what to advice you. I attended a career event at my school and was contacted by them like a week later. The process was very smooth tho! It took about 2 weeks for me.
is that unusual for dc interns?
The one and only reason intern salaries differ is due to location. Otherwise, all interns at a particular location get paid the exact same salary.

All first time interns get their choice of fully paid corporate housing OR $3k net. Returning interns (i.e. interns coming back for their second time as an intern) get their choice of fully paid corporate housing OR a bit more than $3k net (I don't remember the exact amount, but I think it was like $4.5k net). Regardless, basically everyone takes the corporate housing since it's worth a lot more and is a lot less of a hassle. 
> Out of interest, when did you go through the application process to already have the offer? I know they opened them a while back but I just applied a little over a week ago to the Software Dev stream

I already completed this internship last January. I posted in this one because in the last thread no one had posted for Australia. I wanted to dump my offer in here so that people could at least see some info for Aus. 

Good luck with your application
The way internships are done in Australia is a pain with very few being advertised. So annoying when you have to complete one to graduate from most engineering degrees.
what country is this
The cost of living is also low there. So. The math adds up. Same here in India :)
Not really, but I'd guess that it's basically the same as Software Developer interns.
SFU
Yup, this is for co op.

What do you mean by anything special to prepare for this internship? I'm brushing up on the languages I'll be using.
I am, and that's the game I'll be assigned to :)
[deleted]
UBC, McGill, McMaster imo
I know a couple of people who went to U of Ottawa - is it any good?
Still living at home! In hindsight I probably should have negotiated for a higher salary but I was far from confident in myself at the time, and at the very least this job has given me that.
Yap, in Comp Sci
I gave my email for an event, they announced internship positions were available and I applied online. Only two rounds of in-person interviews.
Looks like it's the same with the exception of the salary now being $7250/month (There still is a one-time $7000 housing stipend if you opt-out of corporate housing). There's also a bunch of other allowances, like a $1,200 commute allowance and $300 additional relocation expense allowance (on top of Microsoft paying for your flight).
They started
NoVA is. It's very close to DC.
[deleted]
Aye, I'm quite lucky. I've it earmarked for traveling after I graduate
Nope, the relocation is supposed to cover housing as well
Winter
I can think of some reasons you might be downvoted:

1. Who cares if it's off by 2%?

2. They may have rounded to preserve anonymity. I once got an offer where the base salary had 5 significant figures and the RSU package was not divisible by 10. Without rounding the numbers, someone at the company might figure out who I am.
Nope. I can PM you if you want. 
I thought many people here knew that Google's intern offers are one of the lower ones in the bay area. I reckon most people take it for the "Google" tag and definitely not for financial aspect.
Referrals
What makes you think that? Is the salary the highest for them when it comes to interns?
>I'm not sure about money as a strong signifier of quality for an internship, though.

Agreed, it's probably a weak signal at best.

But on the other hand, what **is** a strong signal of quality? Even within the same company, internships can vary so much by team, I can't really thing of anything strong and reliable.
[deleted]
I work with sensor data (time series).

I do things like anomaly detection, imputes, forecasting or even wrangling tasks and visualization.

I've also written statistics functions like trend detection.

I mostly write functions that i think are of interest, write documentation for them and present it to group. they then tell me what they think of it.
I guess, but I feel like I haven't learned much, and I have bills to pay. I think I was lucky with schooling since most my courses the teachers had experience in the field and we did several projects. So I knew git and testing methods pretty well. The only thing I've learned iss language specific skills.
It was hands down the best interview experience I’ve ever been a part of. They take you to dinner the day before the interview, put you up at a hotel, the next day you have breakfast, learn about the company. They serve you lunch, and afterward you’ll have technical and behavioral interview with really friendly people. Overall, it was a very fun and memorable interview experience. This was for interns though, I don’t think full time new grads get taken to dinner and stay at a hotel. 
Sorry about the confusion! I already interned there this summer. And yes they gave me a return internship offer
I've been waiting too
I am working at a local web dev company
Spokane area actually, haha.
lol typo, 10 weeks
time to move to greener pastures mate
Like starting salaries or intern salaries?
'18
How was the interview process?
GM is in Atlanta as well, and definitely has engineers here. I'm not sure Porsche or MB have engineers in ATL.
I would suggest asking if there’s any kind of reimbursement for gas or something.

Idk if i was special, but i know they do pay for hotels and travel for interviews/orientation as well as housing stipends.
No. But it definitely pushed me to accept the offer
No but educated guess. Lots of co-ops at Comcast tho. 
I had 2 internships here

My specific department, (infrastructure), they entered the interview with the intent of finding out how easily I could learn new things as well as finding how well I would do on the team (5 members).

One small brain teaser question, as well as some light technical questions

1.	functional programming

-	what is your experience with it

2.	Linux experience questions

-	my team was Linux based so this may vary for you.


Some other interns had programming problems (hackercode or whatever that site is)

The team i was on was great, I learned a lot and mixed well with the team. They really are trying to change their position to be a tech company like fb amazon google etc. 

I worked with cutting edge tech too so it’s not like I was doing legacy programming or anything.

Hope this helped, PM me if you want more info on my experience
Very much so. I didn't really like it, but it almost covered daycare (which is the only cost I needed to cover) and gave me pretty good experience. I figured it worth it.

Hence why it's a connection between school (or just "talent pool") and company. Talent pools with a greater density of quality talent will tend to be more represented - that said it's a trend not a rule. You could be one of the best folks in a less densely packed pool of talent.

The type of company is pretty much the largest determinant of your salary.
>makes a lot of assumptions

If you're at a top school recruiters from companies will come out and do interviews on campus (Google, Apple, FB, and a bunch of unicorns) for internships, making it a lot easier to get past the meat market of resumes. My school had these recruiters come out for career fairs and other students from neighboring schools would always try to squeeze into our career fairs too. 
It probably wouldn't affect an offer itself, most of the time. But it potentially affecting the kind of companies that you would get to interview with, and thus get an offer from, means I think it's valuable enough for context's sake to include in the template.
Culture depends on company ofc, but from my experience it is really good. I don't want to sound overly optimistic but Polish market is booming right now. In major cities (rural areas are getting better but you can still feel our Soviet past in the air there) we have job ads in public transport, lack of IT specialists (even with huge waves coming out of universities) and loooow unemployment. This makes a great employee market imho and employers can't really afford a bad treatment. If you want to explore possibilities to work here I can recommend just looking at justjoin.it (no affiliation, edit: monthly salaries given) and get a grasp of how many job opportunities there is every day even on a minor job posting portal.
From my point of view it's better to avoid Polish companies, as many of them (of course there are some exceptions) don't treat employees as good as western companies.
Well, in Warsaw and Cracow there are quite a lot of senior perm positions paying between 12k and 20k zloty (2800-4500€ brut more or less) per month, with the possibility to be hired as a contractor with ~25% tax rate so it's the same or better as earning 70k€ per annum in pure quantity in the likes of Germany, and that's not even taking into account the CoL.

However programming jobs in Poland exist mostly in outsourcing companies and banks, so work might be quite boring and tech stacks are often Java/C# which might not be everyone's cup of tea.
You're probably right regarding the postings from the site. However, info about 120k comes more from my experience and talks with seniors in my teams. Also worth noting that the higher you go, the more recruiting is being done internally, without public job announcements.
Wow that’s fast too. Did you do a coding challenge? 
It's really unfortunate, I've applied for only about 15 since it's almost exclusively large companies looking for penultimate year students who put out advertisements. Luckily for me I still another summer aside from this coming one to finish the required work experience for my engineering degree.

Most of my friends are in the same position, the people I know who are single degree students have enough trouble getting interviews as is that I'll be glad to even get one this year, let alone get an internship.
Pakistan
Yeah i totally forgot about that :P 
75000 AUD is around 3850000 INR, or around 320800 per month. Many developers in India make 3.2 lpm.

SFU instead of McMaster I think
Does UBCO (UBC’s Okanagan campus) share the same reputation as UBC?
And queens 
I would rank several schools above McGill for industry preparedness 
I personally haven't heard much from it, but you can't really go wrong in Ontario 
Would you say it's mostly thanks to co-op that you got the internship? Or do you have side projects/good CV?
[deleted]
If you don't mind me asking, what experience did you have before you got the first FB offer?

PM me too!
Me too please!

Google also offers a 9K lump sum bonus which pushes their offer past most bay area offers actually.
Is there a reason why it's lower? Also, do you know if full-time offers tend to be lower too?
Because they are the only one between the 3 with the corp housing/3500 a month choice 

Ask about previous interns. How many of them came back the next year or for a full time position? On average, how much time per week does a lead spend with an intern? What are some things the last interns learned and improved upon?

There are _plenty_ of great questions to ask. It's like interviewing for any job. Usually salary comes last (but admittedly is far more important for a full time position). By the time salary comes up, you can usually have a good sense of whether it would be a good place to work. It's all about interviewing and asking the right questions. 
> if you can make experience and potential the prime motivating factor for an internship instead of total comp.

Literally my words right there. I understand. I paid myself through school using my earned money and hard work, with almost no outside help. I *understand*.

Read my messages. I never say pay shouldn't be considered. I said to get the most career value out of your position, it can, sometimes, makes sense to not take the high paying one. Yes, it sucks that not everyone had the opportunity to make that choice. Don't you dare accuse me of not thinking about those people because I *was* one (and just a few years ago, too). 

I took an internship with a company that didn't pay the most, but offered great experience and a decent wage that had the opportunity to continue as part time work through the school year. Could I have gone somewhere else and made more during my summers? Yes. But the experience  I got here was way better, and because of the flexibility of the part time work I was able to pay off my student loans before I graduated. I have a couple friends that did similar things, and it worked well for them too. That is why I'm suggesting all of this. What's your background? 
Awesome thanks. I'm thinking of applying for that sort of job next year so it's good to hear about it.

2 technical phone screens covering C, Data structures, Resume, Algos
Ah I see, yeah that would definitely have made it a no brainer for myself
Gotta be IMC!
I see. Here in the UK, from my experience, that isn't really a thing to be honest. So in my eyes, it is a little strange.
Thanks for the info, I think I'm gonna have to start researching Poland more!
True
Ah interesting. That seem to be a bit different to how things work in UK. Typically the higher you go, the sooner you should leave the company if you want more money.
They sent me the coding challenge. It wasn't too difficult so I think I passed it. They then contacted me the next day to schedule the first interview. The second interview is then scheduled in the next week after the first interview. I heard back from them with an offer like a day or two after my 2nd interview.
My advice (because this is how I did it) is to find all the small companies and contact them directly. This is especially true if you're getting desperate. There are quite a few companies around doing interesting stuff that are <10 employees and are completely off the radar. If you can show genuine interest in their work they might take you on. If it's something you really find interesting and they say no, spend the time getting more familiar with their field and ring again next year. Take related units, do a related side project, stuff like that.
There is little point in comparin salaries for those 2 regions unfortunately
That's probably after ~5 years of experience, unless one is talking about Tower Research/Worldquant types.
Sure.
I'll be working on their online systems and services. Don't know much more than that, except that there's some AWS, Docker and Kubernetes involved. I'll know more after my first day tomorrow 
Yeah get Mac out of there 
[deleted]
Yeah I'd say it's mostly thanks to Co-op. I only used their job board when applying.

But I did do my part too in terms of doing well during interviews and having one personal side project which I talked about at every interview.
They were recruiting interns for Seattle in my local area with in-person interviews. I don't believe Microsoft does any software engineering in Australia as all my interviewers were flown in from the U.S. Also I believe the interviewing event I went to was for the whole of Australia or APAC, because there were numerous other people from different cities there.
I don’t go to Waterloo hahaha, I applied for their fall posting a while ago and pushed it back to winter
January - April, but they’re flexible on duration and time.
Probably because of demand. If I threw a stone outside and it landed on someone's head, that person has #1 preference for Google internship. 


No idea about fulltime, but I would guess its one of the higher ones.
[deleted]
I'm only 6 weeks in, still learning a lot. going to continue forecasting and maybe move into some more ML stuff 
$7k gross a month
Based on the interview process OP described, it sounds very much like IMC. However, the offer seems much higher than the one from last year. 
As someone from the UK.. it is most definitely a thing.
You're welcome! Pun intended :D
Oh sweet!! Thanks for sharing. I just have to figure out a way for them to notice me and it’ll be good from there. Congrats again ;))
What's the best way to find these smaller companies?
how come?
But their actual co-op program is pretty extensive, although not to the level of UBC's or Waterloo's.
Alright! Thanks man! 
[deleted]
Hmm..isn't places like Facebook, Amazon, Two Sigma, Citadel, Jane Street, etc. in high demand as well? Yet their internships are some of the highest paid across any industry.
Dude/dudette, you're totally missing the point here. It's a great route if you _can_. I'm sorry you cannot but I tried to make it clear that not everyone can do this. Best of luck to you in your career. 
So having a degree from a more prestigious university means you have a better chance of being given an interview? This could just be my field (Computer Science), but I've never heard of an employer being that narrow-minded.
I would suggest you to reach out to their recruiters and engineers on Linkedin.
Good question. Industry keyword searches on Google may get you some results but can be hit and miss. 

I also looked through LinkedIn for people with the skills and qualifications I wanted to develop or improve and looked at where they worked. 

Keeping an eye on seek and other job sites for companies advertising for positions that you want to work towards. 

Meetups can also be good to get in contact with people in the field and helps you network. A lot of the time the members are a combination of experts and people just starting out. They can be really helpful and encouraging to new people especially if you're keen to learn. Your experience may vary though. I do know of people that ended up getting work through them.
Different cost of living
Cost of living difference is huge, completely differently economically developed etc etc
Yes I would love to! PM me your Facebook and I’ll add you!
Not even as close in demand as Google..... 
Have you never applied to any top tech or quantitative finance companies? Hell just take a gander on LinkedIn. 
I’ve tried contacting like 6 futureforce recruiters but no response. Im about to start my cold emailing spree soon though lool.
Oh, ok...
Hmm I guess I may just be different then.
Yeah for sure. 9/10 people won't know 2S, JS, Citadel, but 10/10 would know Google so its easy to see which gets more applicants.
Yeah I guess for those, but especially for a companies like FB, Amazon, MSFT who are also part of the big 4, I'd assume demand would be just as high. I know for me if I had to choose between FB or Google for example, I'd honestly probably choose FB.

To people who think this is a low effort troll: This is a par for the course salary for interns in my city. We earn about half the minimum wage on average, and are expected to be grateful for whatever is given to us. Either this or nothing and no job experience, though, I suppose.

May 2019 edit: I have interviewed at multiple places in my city, and interned at another place. I have realized this is not par for the course salary for interns in my city.

Congrats. And work hard. The return offer is worth it :P.
enjoy, FB internship programme is amazing!

2 sigma?
Damn. Just curious, do you feel like your pay reflects the work you do? I'm currently at my second internship and still feel like I cost the company way more money than I add in value. 
Holy shit. Is that normal?
This guy f**ks
Hot damn. This is the goal for next Spring and/or Summer.

Hey, how did you have 4 internships before senior year? Are you a super senior? Just curious.
How did you get internship at MIT CSAIL?
ESRI right? I have a couple of friends who had an awesome time last summer and will be going back this year as well!
EECS or CS? Nice offer dude. Im an incoming freshman at Cal, hope to be near your position one day haha! 
hello fellow amazonian
I'm working in wd now in Milpitas, leaving in a week though. Are you in Milpitas? 
Just curious, I am going to Penn State in the Fall and was wondering how the career fairs were for CS? I can’t find a list of companies that attend anywhere on their website.
Now we talking just very very large or very very very large? 
what's an "unofficial ivy"?
Procore?
Wow. How’d you manage to get that? I finished CC and transferring to a pretty good school for CS and I was handed rejections left and right.
Did you negotiate the Housing stipend? I only got $9k as did everyone else I know (also PhD). They said there was no negotiation for interns.

Are you a US citizen? I thought they banned non-US citizens recently. 
Drexel? I got a very similar background and job lol
The brown guys? 
Not the best managers here.
salesforce?
How do you like living in Vegas? 
Curious, if you didn't take either of those what are your plans for the summer?
What was the interview like for you for these companies?
Can I ask how the interview process was for you?
What was the interview process like for you? Congrats btw
Damn, that's actually a really good deal, considering how SWE's are usually treated in Korea. If you don't mind me asking, which company and how did you apply?
Wow that’s really good for salary!! Usually around Ottawa it’s around 20$ an hour on average. May I ask what company it is? I’d love to apply next term if their salary is that good lol

Wow, you make more money than my friend who has 5 years of experience as a web developer. He knows multiple component frameworks and multiple MVC frameworks, he writes performant database queries and complex RESTful APIs, he knows unit testing, he knows design patterns and he's probably the best developer I know other than some of my family members.

You should try to really hard to get hired on full time at that company.
Username checks out. 

Definitely a UW student.
Hey, can I ask if this is London Life?
I'm assuming you are a rambling wreck? Just out of curiosity, did you take this over the two US internships you posted in the medium COL post?
That's ($1200) what more than the average junior gets in Lisbon, so I imagine it's pretty great in Brasil.

FCT UNL
[deleted]
Yup
Pretty well, got an offer to come back for full-time.

The intern program is AMAZING, they literally have so many incentives and perks that are just thrown at you. I was definitely convinced to work here after college.
No these companies usually don't get a return on investment by the time most students finish their internship. Especially when you factor in the cost of other employees helping them when needed. The return on investment comes if they choose to return full time. And by being one of the most lucrative internships out there its a pretty good chance they succeed. 
What do you mean by normal? No "normal" people get quant firm gigs. 
Seen higher. Seems normal for finance.
YMMV. My friend worked at a HFT firm and while making similar mad bank, absolutely hated it. 250k new grad return offer and he turned it down without a second thought. 
Also, can we point out how ridiculous the COL in SF is where they're paying $3500 a month for an *intern's* rent? That's what a junior software engineer takes home in a lot of places. 
After tax that 3500 is about 2200 take home + 500 for corporate housing so really its like paying 2700 for your own 1br in dt SF which is 100% worth it.
SF rent is no joke
Yes, that is correct. Still worth it in my situation.
I was in Amazon corporate housing as a Twitch intern and it was **very** luxurious and a 10 minute walk from the office in the financial district. Very well worth it, IMO. The nicest home I've ever lived in, ever.
Not OP, but some people take fall internships and spring internships too, not just summer. At least I think that’s OP’s situation
My money is they go to Waterloo with co-ops every 4 months
CS. Pm me if you need any advice or anything.
allo m8
Nope, I'll be working out in Newark. How'd you like working for them? (Also are you an intern or a full-time employee?)
Career fairs are pretty big and there are a lot of companies looking for CS interns. Most of the companies at career fair are east coast companies (Big 4 have separate on-campus events). Although I didn't find much success or interest in them, I know a lot of people who found internship opportunities there.
MIT maybe
TBH internship hunting combined with college apps over the past year has been absolutely awful.

I applied to 400+ places (both in-depth and easy apply applications) and reached out to more than 100 recruiters on LinkedIn.

I interviewed with 11 companies, 5 of those went further than 1st round interviews, and I ended up with 3 offers.

I think having previous internship experience was helpful, and I also have a somewhat [active Github](https://github.com/theriley106) which was mentioned a lot during the interviews.

Honestly though, Freshman internships are so insanely hard to get, and it makes it **so much harder** coming from a CC.  Hopefully it's a lot easier for us next year, and I wouldn't sweat it at all if you don't have anything lined up for this summer.  




No. I'm outside of US, so it may be the difference.
I think it’s Spotify. Not sure though
University of FAANG, obviously
One of Berkeley, Stanford, CMU, and MIT.

Huh? 
Nope :) we do compete with parts of salesforce, though!
A different internship. Check the Latin America tab. 
Macy's was just a quick recruiter screening (that I never did lol), a Google form with simple technical questions, and one interview. It was mostly behavioral with a couple of random Java trivia questions. I will say that the interviewer clearly wasn't following the paper he had in front of him. 

Qualcomm was two interviews, one onsite at a career fair with the guy who would be my "technical mentor", and a followup interview with the same guy plus my would be Project Manager. Both interviews were technical, but not in the Leetcode sense. They grilled me on my resume. This was far from the "typical" position that you would interview for at Qualcomm, so I can't guarantee that another interview would be the same. 
It was relatively simple, first interview is with HR, who really don't know much about CS/development. It was more just behavior based interviewing looking for evidence of leadership, persistence, and other positive qualities. After this your applicant profile gets put into a pool where individual teams look for interns, the are the actual technical folks. If a team is interested in interviewing you, you will get contacted by HR to set up a call with them. This is where they will ask you about your CS experience, projects, and technical skills. For me, there was only one simple coding question. They will also tell you about their team and what their role is in the organization. If your resume is pretty stacked, you'll likely get a technical interview with more than one team.
Internship itself is great, lots of networking opportunities with senior leadership.
Fairly easy. Met at career fair, phone interview, online aptitude assessment (not technical cs wise), follow up phone interview (little more in depth), offer
>considering how SWE's are usually treated in Korea.

? My univ seniors working in Korea full time have actually pretty good opinion on this. In their opinion they are being well paid for their work and are being treated well. Don't mean it as an offense but this sub has a pretty biased view when it comes to  jobs in Asia. :)

>how did you apply?

So they came to our campus for a job fare like event where they picked few interns and few full time employees.


I’m assuming web dev isn’t a huge industry in Canada then? I know Ottawa is mostly communications type companies so there’s a big market for software and computer engineers who are able to program more low level stuff. 

Just asking because my side project this summer was gonna be doing some web dev stuff :) 
It is not sorry
Yes. I go to GT and they were recruiting at the Global Internships fair. This was after the data breach so nobody paid any attention to them lol. 

The other two offers paid a lot more, but I took this one because three months in another country \>\>\> money. 
Exactly. Also, it's better to apply for something you're passionate in, like databases in my case, as it translates to a better project proposal and more chances of getting in.
*Question in portuguese*: Com que nota (média) entraste no ensino superior?
[deleted]
It's still about £10 an hour, which for no experience is not bad in my opinion. 
Jealous af   
The salary and signing bonus
Yeah, this is pretty normal for a bulge bracket or quant firm. Don't understand why you're being downvoted.
For 250k Ill get over it lmao. Im gonna be like 100k in debt after college.
one thing that inflates the price is that the intern would be renting month-to-month (or some other limited engagement contract) which is far more expensive than a year long contract. that kind of expense is also taxed at a higher rate so that compounds it.
It's $3500 pre-tax which is a lot less post-tax.  And it's Amazon so it's expected they'll pay a lot more than an average junior.
You're dramatically overestimating the taxes involved. Actual taxes for this (assuming 3 months of salary + stipend):

Total Income: $35,925

- Federal: $2421.84
- CA State: $645.30
- FICA/Medicare: $2,748.26

This doesn't include their home state rate, but CA has one of the highest state income tax rates in the union, and states generally credit you for taxes paid in other states, so this is going to be within a few hundred dollars of the correct number.

Total combined tax rate is ~16%, meaning $3500 becomes ~$2940. If OP pays their tuition with that money and provides more than 50% of their own total support this calendar year they can take their own education tax credit, which means they will only pay FICA/Medicare, for a total tax burden of 7.65%, or a take home of $3232.25 of each $3500.

tl:dr - Amazon convenience housing costs OP $3440-3732 post-tax each month.
Doubly so for short term rentals.
I doubt it's worth it unless you're working the whole year, because you're paying minimal tax on a 3-month internship.

Of course, if you're rich and don't want to deal with finding a place on craigslist or whatnot, then it's your choice.

Sure, it costs Amazon 6k, whatever, but that doesn't mean the place is worth 6k to you.
Were you on Mission St too?   
^ this. I did summer then fall at two (different) unicorns after my sophomore year.
Nice dude! I'm intending CS too, wish me luck on the GPA cap. Currently trying to self study as much of 61A as a I can before school starts -- i'm absolutely terrified. What year are you? 
I'm a full-time employee now! Was an intern in 2016 and got the return offer. (We didn't have free housing..)

To be honestly, it hasn't been great. It was overall a lot better when I was interning, talent wise, culture wise, etc. lately there's been quite a few people leaving (including me soon). But this is just for the team here in Milpitas, you may have a better experience in Newark, good luck!
Awesome thank you, I’m also interested in accounting and Smeal College of business has their stats online on employment rates which is really nice, I wish CS did too.
“Not known for CS”
Ay finally someone knows the struggle of even getting an interview as a CC student...you can have a great gpa, knowledge, and attitude and you’ll get rejected regardless.  

Yeah I think it’ll be easier at a 4 year for sure.

Congrats on your Tesla internship man, you def deserved it!
"somewhat active" haha shiiiiiiit, nice going man
Spotify doesn't have an office in Seattle, IIRC.
A9 is kinda separate and they have different hiring practices from the traditional Amazon. I'm fairly certain Amazon isn't taking international students except under some specific exceptions.  Good going though!

Edit: for US offices
Lol I thought you were me. Lmk if you want a study buddy come fall, im gonna be looking for ppl to prep and do mocks and stuff then. I rarely see people from our school on here
My comment is based off speculation on where you are working, and my experience  at the company.
damn it, haha, thought i got it! 
Thank you and congrats!
Cool, thanks! Congrats btw
Technology, in general, isn't huge north of USA. Workers are very commonly underpaid - in Van, they actually bragged to Amazon to open up another Amazon tech HQ in Van because of "how low we pay our workers". I saw that article and I was like wtf.
Fellow GT \(grad\) student here. I totally agree with your decisions as you won't have much difficulty finding jobs as a top 10 cs degree candidate after the internship, especially considering you were in the position to turn down multiple internship offers. I wish I studied/interned abroad myself undergrad. And I Lol'ed at your assessment of Equifax, I remember barely seeing anyone for their booth in the career fair. Enjoy!
15,84, mas tem vindo a subir. Não sei se este ano entras com isso. És de que ano?
Comment still holds.. Normal people don't get gigs in quant firms so, ergo, it's not "normal" but rather exceptional.
no swe intern makes that much at a bulge bracket. definitely hedge fund or quant shop.
Probably comes off as arrogant or not specific enough.
Housing stipend is taxed differently. I interned at Amazon and I only got about 2200 out of the 3500.
Yeah and especially when you're coming from a different continent.
340 fremont
Rising Senior. I tried to self-study some of 61a before freshman year, but honestly they do a really good job teaching it so I wouldnt worry too much about that class.
Damn, sorry to hear all that. Thanks for the info and good luck to you too!
There also should be a list of employers on the site when the career fair comes closer. Penn State does send out email reminders for events like these so don't worry too much about them rn tbh. Just make sure you have a resumé ready by then and you should be Gucci
Oh I'm a moron lmao I only read what the guy quoted
Oh kk my bad. I’m not sure then

Tyvm
I think we have a decent tech market here, nothing compared to the US, but enough to make a pretty good living if you live in one of the cities with a tech hub. 

And geez that’s actually pretty sad if they said that!! Obviously they wouldn’t pay 250k a year like the Bay Area does but come on... 😒
11º ano com média de 15,2. Talvez consiga aumentar para um 16 porque no 12º Ano alunos que tinham notas razoáveis tem dezoitos e dezanoves nas disciplinas de Aplicações Informáticas e de Biologia. Gostas do teu curso btw?
Neat! Good for OP :)
No, it's not. It's just that the employer is on the hook for ensuring it's taxed (i.e. they are actually financially responsible and have to claw back the taxes from you, unlike your salary), so they put it through their system with a prediction of your tax rate that expects you to be on an annual salary. Since you're only working 3 months, you will be overtaxed.

If you've done your taxes correctly, you received a large refund as a result.

Source: I also received a housing stipend in 2017.
Oh that place looks REALLY nice, I work really close to it. I'm at 680 Mission   
Relatively small company, but been around for like 10 years and is IPO. I'd rather not post the company because that'd be too identifiable 
Really? That's very weird. I got told straight up by the recruiter that they are not hiring J1 interns. I'm also from Waterloo but I applied externally I guess that's why? 


I know A9 is still doing J1 with no problems, but I guess I had bad luck with Amazon.

Best of luck for your internship!
No 11º tinha média de 15 e no 12º não fazia nada da vida, por isso consegues chegar lá na boa. Inscreve-te em disciplinas em que aches que tiras boas notas e estuda para os exames. De resto o 12º é provavelmente o ano mais descontraído da vida depois do infantário.  
  
Gosto, o curso é muito fixe e eu tenho um teste amanhã mas estou aqui a procrastinar ahah.
Gotcha my bad

Congrats!  Impressive for a freshman.  
Is the corporate housing provided for free, or does it come out of your paycheck?
How did you intern in high school?
[deleted]
Take cash in hand or don't take the cash and pay extra for corporate housing? Interesting. 
As someone who interned in Irvine, the corporate housing is nice apartments across the street from the office. I highly recommend corporate housing for Amazon Irvine interns.

That's an insane offer for a CC freshman. Do you have any side projects or?
I don't mean to be a downer, but 21/hr is pretty low for a high CoL area, don't you think? Since it's just an internship low pay is no big deal, but in the future it's important to know how much you're worth in the market.
[deleted]
$100/hr is way higher than everyone else. Congrats.
Just curious, why did you opt for MS in 18 instead of M. Eng? or are you a PhD student?

congrats anyways!
Is this rly right? Isn't that above GS15? 
Mitre?
Qualcomm pays that much?? I was under the impression they hovered around the high 20s for hourly pay. Congrats!!!
[deleted]
I'm also a junior at UC Berkeley with an offer at Visa. Congrats on the offers. Any idea on which one you're about to choose?
46/hr in NH?? Damn that’s more than a lot of companies in the Bay for internship. 
Curious as to which one you selected?

Congrats. Its amazing that a sophomore has 2x SWE internship as well as a PM internship.
Whoa, FB has SWE positions in DC?
I think MS was a better choice, but the other is fine.
Intuit?
>ThrowAwayForCSQIntrn

PSU ?
A CSU that's not SLO?

Did they recruit from your school or did you just apply online and get an interview that way?
Are you the Kevin I met at the Basking Ridge Superday back in October by chance? 

I was wondering about that cryptic email they sent us for transportation, are we just going to be taking Uber every day or something? I asked about biking distance but they mentioned it'd be in excess of 1.5 hours.

Anyways see you in the summer :)
what i would do to find a $25/hr fulltime in orlando...

Damn dude, great job! Hope to be in your shoes next year
That's a LOT of money for Houston. Also, define "Private State School". Is it under a state university system?
Don't have to feel bad dude, its an internship! and Sophomore is pretty rad.
I live here in georgia too and i have a pretty good idea who you're interning with and it'll help out on your next internship for sure
Cybersecurity in Atlanta near MARTA? 99% sure I know this employer... And like the other guy said, don't feel bad about it. Be fortunate you have an internship.
Oh wow GSU in the house. I'm not the only one.
Nice work!
How much Spanish do you speak?
are you from Chile?
Unrelated, but do you know of any meetups/conferences in Montreal over the summer? 
Are you from Waterloo or McGill?
That's amazing, I'm pretty sure most new grads in Montreal don't get paid that much out of school!
How did you get these offers. Do you apply some where?
Is this real? How can you survive in Paris with 556 EUR?
Minimum salary is 8.50 EUR/hour, your friend should at least receive that. Or is it a mandatory internship required by his degree?
TUM, Munich, at BMW/Siemens?
Question to you: Don't you get depressed looking at the salaries in pretty much any other part of the world?

Rent and taxes are not on the cheap side in Europe and yet I'm sorry to say your salary is a rounding error.
what's a graduation internship, sort of a probation period for new hires? or is it the same as your third year internship but just post-qualification
Oh, now I get it, the bot made a different comment for every location. Thanx! 
Apple corporate housing kinda sucks though
Unless they've changed it since last summer it's free, and they gross up compensation so you don't pay taxes on the housing (which my roommate last summer didn't believe for a long time haha).
HP code wars probably. They will pick you up if you’re good. 
[deleted]
Yeah... I'm probably going to opt for the corporate housing, especially if I get placed in San Francisco.  
thanks
Some random dude whose heavily interested in math finance

I don't really get involved in the CS community, I tried but its not my thing. (CS Major math minor)

if u have any questions or need advice or wanna know more just PM me, I wont reveal myself however 

Yes.
Truth be told I'm already working here, but got the offer in November so I figured it'd still be helpful for people.

The answer is that it varies widely based on the office and team you work on. For me it's GPU programming with CUDA, for others it's getting GPIO working on a rasperry pi, or making a GUI for some device, etc. You apply to a specific position for NASA internships, not a general thing like most companies.
Yes, do you know anything about them?
Graduating in December. I'm just a bit off stream in my courses.
Taking an extra semester to graduate maybe? 
No housing stipend though, so a good chunk of it goes to rent.
Thanks for the advice. I'm not too concerned with the money, more the experience! Most of my friends at the same school are making $15-16/hr through the co-op program. So I'm pretty pumped where I am starting!
The greater Boston area is on the low end of "High COL" and shouldn't be confused as an area comparable to NYC/SF
I don't work for the government. I work for a security vendor (through my professor). They're charging the government about $250-300/hr for my work. The professor with whom I'm doing research is charging $500/hr and probably getting around $200/hr.
Nah, it's only about $115k-150k a year because it's part-time.
Yeah lol I want to get my ScD sometime in the near 10 years lmao.
I'm a contactor not a ft employee
Thank you! I thought that too because on Glassdoor the average is around ~$30 but they pay based on what year you are I think. The housing being covered makes even ~$30 awesome.
Former intern at Qualcomm here. They pay 27/hr for freshman, 33 for sophomore, 38 for juniors, and 40+ from grad students. Housing is paid for and 85% of interns live in very luxurious apartments in La Jolla. The freshman and some others are placed in long term suite hotels with free breakfast and shuttles to Qualcomm. Another plus is that San Diego is a beautiful city. Pm if you have questions 
Thanks dude, it’s my first internship and im excited!
Congrats to you too! I chose the startup, so I won't be at Visa :(


I signed Google for summer and FB for fall. Thanks, I did a internship the senior summer after high school and did a part-time internship my freshman spring.
Yeah very few though. Only 20 or so full time engineers.
Depends on perspective. People give amazon too much shit :(
Went to a conference
I'm not. They're going to do that, yeah. We can probably split it with roomates, but it still sucks. I might drive a motorcycle from CA, but not sure.   

I thought biking might've been an option too - damn. There's a $28 round trip train to NYC though!   

Are you picking shared housing? And totally see you there buddy! :)
If we’re getting technical, it’s Lake Buena Vista, not Orlando, but yeah, I hear ya.
Thanks, I *do* actually like working here. Everyone is super helpful and I’ve been learning a ton. I just need to keep reminding myself that this only my first gig. 😄
I'm minoring in Spanish, but nowhere near fluent. I can hold a halfway decent conversation if I stop and think before I speak. Chilean Spanish is pretty different from regular Spanish, and they speak English in the Santiago office. 
No. Never left the US and not Hispanic either. 
No, sorry!
McGill, I thought I was going to Waterloo for a bit but chose McGill instead.
Yeah, I was really pleasantly surprised at the compensation. Most of the other Montreal places I was interviewing at were around the 18-24 range!
I got one of them after landing an interview after a career event. The other 2 I got through my school's co-op website!
You can't is the answer really. Either live with parents or use savings, loans or some other supplemental income to pay for your living. Paris is notoriously bad paying for internships. Gets even worse outside CS/engineering.
Yes, it's required by his degree. Another friend is doing a voluntary internship at the same company but since his is only 3 months and he is technically still a student he also doesn't get the minimum salary.
That moment when all the interns are paid more than you in your senior dev position... lol
Yeah I do get depressed. I wish I could leave and simply join some company in canada or the US but I guess this is what I'm stuck with.

Atleast this company is close to where I live with my parents so I don't pay rent.
Some countries (notably France) have an internship semester instead of having to write a thesis. What's quite interesting about this is that you can also take on a full-time job and pass that off as an internship to effectively start working one semester before graduation.

Maybe it's the same system in the Netherlands?
No worries! 😀
[deleted]
Also corporate housing is luxurious as fuck
I won't fault you for taking the corporate housing since $500/m would be absurdly cheap for SF and I'm sure they'll be placing you in a pretty nice place (and you won't have to worry about searching for an apartment).

Just want to point out, you can get a nice place in SF for waaaay less than $3500.  You could have an ok single for probably $1500/m or a pretty niiiice place for $2000-2500/m and pocket the extra $1-2k/m.  $3500/m in SF would get you something pretty damn luxurious.
[deleted]
Late to the party...but any tips for landing first internships? Not really into the cs community here either. 
Thats actually super cool

Did you have prior experience doing GPU programming? 

Also how challenging are the projects?
They are a good company. Worked for them in Fall 2015. they are growing fast and expanding faster. The area that they are in is also very nice, it's amazing if you are a baseball fan since Fenway Park is 2 blocks down. Their office is also right above a train station.
You should be!

You have your whole life to make money anyways. Congrats!
>  I'm not too concerned with the money, more the experience!

Of course, I totally agree. That's an excellent attitude to have. Like I said, didn't mean to discourage you or others.
To the surprise of many, Boston actually has the 3rd highest rent of all cities in the US! While it may not be as prestigious as SF, it is definitely a lovely place to work / live.
Okay, that I didn't know. Thanks.
Damn, respect. Good luck lol
Welcome to the Q . I am an Engineer there in Bldg Q and we get to see a lot of interns :-) 
wow silly me. I didn't notice your flair haha, sorry for asking a redundant question.

Congratulations! Hope you have an amazing experience
[deleted]
Wow, congrats.
For good reason. You'll be slave-driven at AMZ.
NSBE FRC? 
How tough is a Verizon interview? Any leetcode type problems?
That's a longass drive on a motorcycle but it'd be a pretty cool to say you've biked across the country. 

Yeah I'm doing the shared housing. It sounds decent but honestly for 10 weeks it could be a crackhouse for all I care, most of my time won't be spent there anyways.

Goodluck on the motorcycle trip if you end up doing it. If you can, take some extra time on the way up to visit some places like Salt Lake City, Chicago, etc.
Did 2 internships in he security space, both at $15 an hour for the same company. KC, MO so relatively low COL. accepted an offer from the same company for 55k (~26/hr). Less than 1 year after graduating now doing government security contracting for $40/hr. It gets better over time! The only way to go is up. Also, if you can work on getting certs while your in school, do it! Maybe even try to get your employer to cover the cost because some of them are expensive. I recommend starting with a small one like CompTIA network+ or Security+. Those give you a huge leg up come graduation when your looking for employment
why would u leave
Totally agree, I don't have other choice than to live with my parents. The highest paid internship that I know of is a friend with 1800€ / month which is quite good in France.
I think minimum salary requirement also applies if you're still a student... That's just plain exploitation if they're paying that little.
huh. amazing how different all these systems are that get us all to the same place

>Maybe it's the same system in the Netherlands?

We have an internship semester AND writing a thesis. Both in the last semester. The thesis is about your project and research that you do to complete it
You're not going to get a 3 month lease in SF. Even if you could, you'd have to deal with furnishing it for 3 months, which is a pain in the ass. You can always find a room on craiglist or airbnb, but it's going to be a pain in the ass, either with parking, or they'll have loud dogs barking all day, or something else. The actual pay from one summer while in college is negligible in the long run. What really matters is you graduate with a good job, and get set on the right path. Taking the corporate housing will be much less stress for someone moving to a new city.

That said, you don't have any control over location if you take the corporate housing. You might be across the street from the office, or you might be 5 miles away.
[deleted]
That is pre-tax dude. They tax bonuses at half and he's going to get about $1750.
Is it MSFT? Their the only big 4 I got an offer from, got rejected from all the others lol
Thanks, I think it's really cool too. 

I had zero experience with GPU programming before now, but I did have a lot of work with parallel programming. The thing that got me the job was a letter of recommendation from a previous boss that outlined I was willing and able to learn new things as necessary, which is what my current boss really wanted (what junior has experience in CUDA ya know?)

The only reason I'm on reddit right now is because my project is challenging and I'm taking a break haha. They have big expectations but they aren't unrealistic. Would highly recommend applying here if you're interested.
Thanks so much! I worked hard for it and this sub definitely helped motivate me to be the best that I can be and learn a lot more on my own :) While it may not be a Big-N making ~8k a month, it is more than enough to put food on my table and be happy.
Hmm, that's quite surprising. There definitely are some areas like Beacon Hill and Back Bay that are very expensive but in the majority of areas, judging by my own experience and the experience of friends, it's not hard to find a place where you can pay under $1000/mo (or around 1000) in rent if you have roommates. 
I asked for Fall after I had received an offer for summer. That's pretty interesting actually since most people who got offers for MPK or Seattle (even way back in november) had the option of starting September 4 or 17(basically a fall internship).
Thank you :) Hope everything with you goes well also
For 12 weeks...not a lifetime :P
Nah
It was a joke. None.
> it could be a crackhouse for all I care, most of my time won't be spent there anyways.

Totally agree lol. If you find any cool stuff to do there, hit me up; I'll try to do the same. Probably going to go to NYC a few times. Maybe check out local hiking or something idk. Supposed to be green as fuck.
Sounds like a really cool life experience to be in Chile for a Summer.
No, check this out: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/milog/__22.html

Translation: Minimum salary doesn't apply if you're doing a voluntary internship of up to three months while at the same time being a student. You also aren't entitled to any pay at all if you are required to do a six months internship for your degree, so that friend is lucky he gets paid a generous 3.87€ per hour.

I'm not disagreeing that it's exploitation, btw.
Another thing (which I have only heard second-hand) is that you don't really pass/fail individual classes in French unis, you either advance or redo the entire semester.

Maybe someone who studied in France can chime in.
How is that possible when a thesis is normally 30 ECTS?
You don't need a car, Amazon office is on the embarcadero if I'm not mistaken, you can get to and from work and around downtown on public transit no problem. And yeah you can't get a lease but there's definitely sublets on Craigslist and Facebook, and those will be mostly or fully furnished.

I agree that the internship money isn't important in the long run which is why I said I wouldn't fault the guy for taking corporate housing, it's hugely convenient and usually super nice. I'm just saying renting in San Francisco isn't so expensive that you need $3500/m to live decently, he/she can pocket several thousand dollars which might be a lot for a struggling college student who wants to live on that internship money for the rest of the school year. 
Agreed. That was my rationale for picking corp housing in an SF company. Searching for a place is too damn stressful.
True. But OP is an intern so presumably their taxes are pretty low if you include what he/she will get back in tax rebate. 
They WITHHOLD around half. You get a bunch of it back in your tax return because your reported income for the year is way less than what would be expected by the hourly rate you're getting paid.
[deleted]
Yeah wow thats nuts man, that's a super cool opportunity. I personally know only like one person whose used CUDA before, and he/she doesn't even know it too well. 

Are you looking to work there full-time?
[deleted]
how does an internship in the fall work? are you taking time off from school?
0 weeks is better than 12.
*Winter. Either way it's better than Hotlanta lol.
oh for a summer only, gotcha!
The internship is the thesis. And it is 30 credits yes, why shouldn't it be possible?
[deleted]
Yeah I know AMZN has Rutgers as a target school

Congrats on your offer though, full-time or intern and what yr are you?
To be honest, I'm not. I love NASA, my work is great and has tangible results, but the pay just doesn't do it for me. I'll be going back to one of the other companies I've interned at for this reason, which I also enjoyed a lot.

I think working at one of the other centers like Langley would make the wage a bit more reasonable but the massive difference in wage isn't worth the minor difference in job satisfaction for me.
Thank you :) I hope you end up getting fall as well. Just reach out to your recruiter in May
Yes, I came in with a ton of AP/IB credits so I am able to graduate on time.
Think Amazon has been changing. Current intern here and most of the teams are pretty fun. Table tennis everyday or skiing events for other teams, most people come in around 10-11 and leave around 5-6.
Oh, you can do the same thing in Germany. You just need to find a professor who signs off on your topic if you write your thesis in a company.
You're going to be filing a tax return no matter what. I agree it's much easier to take the corporate, but that doesn't change the fact that OP could net several thousand extra dollars, which is the only point I was trying to make. 
Hey I go to rutgers also, in nyc this summer too, maybe i'll see u haha. Feel free to pm my if you wanna make a groupme or something Edit: Junior, intern.
Don't blame you, that pay is stinky dinky for the location!

Always wished I could have interned there once in my life

Good luck!


They’re huge companies so it is team dependent. I have a recent grad relative at Amazon who is constantly working 10 hour days, and a recent grad friend at Microsoft whose manager yelled at her even as an intern (but she took the return offer anyway). 
[deleted]
Pm me during the summer I'll be down to join, I'm just not trying to get anything revealed atm sorry 
Yeah agreed, i guess what I’m saying is that Amazons not as bad an option that people make it. My friend at Fb also says he works around 10hrs a day but at the big 4s none of these hrs are mandatory, its just whatever hours you need to get your stuff done. Could be less could be more
During my internship with them in 2016, my taxes for housing and relocation were covered, and wasn't taken from my salary. 
sure no prob

**School/Year:** 2nd year bachelor's student at Cal State East Bay

**Prior Experience:** No work experience, but lots of contributions to various open source projects (especially two popular open source media players), two iOS apps with 100,000+ downloads, and one Android app with 50,000+ downloads. I took two years off after high school to dick around and work on side projects and whatnot to expand my portfolio and I applied to many jobs but all of them rejected me since I didn't have a degree (despite doing well in technical interviews) so I decided to go to college.

**Company/Industry:** Industry typically known for paying less

**Title:** Programmer intern

**Location:** Bay Area, CA

**Duration:** 3 months

**Salary:** $14/hour

**Relocation/Housing Stipend:** None. I am a local so none needed either.

Sucks but it gets worse. I know a few people that got $12.75/hour in SF. This was at a rather small tech company owned by a much larger corporation. We all took these offers because when you have no experience, you take what you can get and then hope to build off it. It's obviously a terrible feeling knowing everyone else out here is making at minimum 2x as much and you're the lowest paid, but oh well. 

If i could do it again, i would do a ton of side projects to put on my resume that would make it much more attractive. This would give me a chance at getting interviews for actual better internships. Then it is a matter of studying CTCI to pass the interview.

Definitely would not recommend BNY Mellon if you have other options. The superday was very unorganized, and IMO the whole "innovation center" concept is a sham. Also, they don't give full-time return offers to interns (you would have to reapply and enter the same application pipeline as external applicants).

More than I make at my full time job when you factor in the housing stipend. Kill me. 

I don't have a Masters tho tbf.
Hey, I'm curious -- how do you feel like you set yourself apart?
Holy shit man, good for you!  Any way you could PM me your GitHub?
Never thought I'd see Appian mentioned here! I just signed a full time offer from them. Do you go to school in the area? Would be quite a coincidence if we went to the same one
Congratulations that's awesome! Care to share how you got attention from these companies, or why you think they got back to you? I applied online/talked at career fairs to these companies myself but didn't get any responses. Maybe I was too late?
Any insight as to why you picked Airbnb over the rest of your offers?
Interesting... everyone got offered 43/hr from uber but I got 40. Do you think they do it by which grade you're in? I'm a sophomore and you're a junior. Can I ask what the exact number is? Just got my verbal offer over the phone today and maybe I heard wrong.
No Haskell means a no go in my book! Galois or NOTHING! 🚨 😤 🚨
Curious what are your thoughts on Appian? They don't seem to be in the same league as your offers, but maybe I'm wrong? Interviewing next week!
5 top companies. You legit must be a genius. 
Which are you leaning towards? Microsoft?
What's the listing for capital one SWE interns? I looked at their site and everything looks like analytics or business. I'd love to intern there because their headquarters is close to my parents and is one of the few technical DC area companies that doesn't require a security clearance.
Microsoft offers a rental car for the duration of your internship? :O  
  
Edit: Woops I understand now. I would totally pay for the car! 
Congrats! Looks like you really hustled and Amazon's lucky to have you.

As a non Boston student Hubspot offered me $35/hr and a $3k signing bonus which one could certainly put towards relocation costs.
Good job fellow husky.
> target Canadian School

With that many co-ops you can just say you go to UWaterloo lmao. 

Congrats on the kickass offers, though!
What was the process like for yelp? I'm curious because I just applied!
[deleted]
Hey was there a signing bonus? 
How did you get noticed? What type of side projects?
FWIW, I also got a Yelp offer for SF but only $91,520 annualized and $4500 for housing. Maybe the lower pay is because I'm a sophomore?
Congratulations!
Another badger! I remember talking to Capital One at the career fair.
shit dude you did all this and only a sophomore? you're killing it, nice
That sounds very impressive. I am a sophomore myself and I wonder how were you to get all those wonderful offers? I am more interested in Side-projects, GitHub and how your CV looks? Also, how experienced are you with Algorithms and data structures?
Just out of curiosity, why didn't you choose Uber? I'm trying to make a similar choice between offers.
> Uber

Do you have any idea how/what went into account for your uber offer salary? I am a sophomore as well and was offered 40/hr.
How do you know the location for Amazon? Isn't that subject to team placement?
Did you apply to Amazon for fall, or get it pushed back?
>  but lots of contributions to various open source projects (especially two popular open source media players), two iOS apps with 100,000+ downloads, and one Android app with 50,000+ downloads.

How did you get so good at mobile dev that you were able to make such popular apps? Is that what you were doing those 2 years?
Congrats man! 
It's ridiculous you are so qualified (mobile apps) and they still wouldn't interview you. Seems counter-intuitive to not interview someone who's already shown they are a capable coder! Nonetheless, congrats!
Did you happen to have a side project that helped you stand out?
cisco getting stingy, which csu?
What did you do to get noticed?
[deleted]
Is amazon’s stipend for housing taxed? Like do you get the full 2.5k per month or do you get 2.5k - taxes?
gonna be pretty hard to break even in mountain view with $2500 pretax
Yikes if they're giving $10K for the whole summer they should at LEAST have free housing or a stipend.
Don't accept dude. That is not a livable wage in Mountain View.
It is very low, especially for the area, but don't sweat it man. You got a paying internship and that's better than most of your peers in itself.

Imagine how I feel when I see interns making more than me as a full-time. Always keep in the back of you rmind that this subreddit is really a small upper portion of the CS population. If you always compare your value to others, it's impossible to be successful. Like you said, you found a starting point, and it's only up from there.
Better than nothing. Congrats. They actually ask you CTCI-type questions for internships?
> I know a few people that got $12.75/hour in SF.

The minimum wage here is $14/hr...
> The Goldman Sachs

[Reminded me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx4poQw1mZo)
Since you mentioned a return offer: Do you know which locations Amazon considers "premium" in the salary/housing? My recruiter hasn't responded
new firm or same as before?
How does Goldman NYC tech interns get 100k prorated when their banking and trading interns get 85K prorated? 
Is the trading firm IMC? I don't know of any others that do a CTA pass
optiver?
[deleted]
ay look who it is
bitcamp?
Mind sharing which prop shop in NY?
jane street, 2 sigma, citadel?
impressive

is there a reason the finance companies are all 10 weeks (and not 12)?
Hey I'm gonna be working with Azure this summer as well! Congrats!
(ugh)
Same MS offer lol
Any tips on landing DO? What skills do you think they looked for? Was rejected by the resume screen, but DO is my dream company.

(Side note: Did not have a big 4 internship when I applied to DO)
Holy cow, I didn't know Digital Ocean paid that well haha. EDIT: oh no housing stipend
Who pays 11k/mo?
I go to Rutgers as a junior as well, when did you start applying to get all these offers. I started applying in september and haven't gotten much progress yet. You can pm me if you want.
was the Qualtrics housing stipend $1500 for you? I was told that it was $1250 across the board for all interns :( 
hey there, if u don’t mind me asking, what was your area of research? 
When did you apply? I applied for the same internship and my status has been under consideration for a month.
Mind sharing which HFT in New York?
Top 4 CS school or Top 4 National?
Nicee!
Congrats on your offers!
I was wondering how did you manage to have enough time to interview for Facebook and Airbnb while having Uber offer? Did Uber give you a lot of time to decide?
Nice offers. Are you leaning towards accepting Optiver?
Out of curiosity, what made you pick MSFT over FB? 
What team at MS are you on?
How'd you get $8100 at Amazon? The standard non negotiable offer is 7725?
Is the Google $9k stipend before or after taxes? Last summer, I was given a $5k stipend at my company but on the payment summary, if showed it as a bonus of $9k+ which would be reduced to around $5k after bonus, federal, and state taxes were applied. Curious to know if google does this or are they really giving $9k flat.
Sorry for the late reply! 

Did you try negotiating google at all with your amazon offer since it ends up being decently larger when comparing housing/relo as well?
Is Amazon’s stipend 2.5k per month before or after taxes?
Congrats on Microsoft!  How long did it take for you to hear back after applying to Explore?  I'm a freshman and I have another deadline but nobody I can contact.
which one are you leaning towards accepting?

Just curious but how did you apply to Tinder?
How did you get data science roles as a junior? Did you have extensive research background?

I could be wrong but $3500 for housing in Seattle sounds pretty damn neat.
> Microsoft

What did you do to increase your salary? Most comments here show interns getting $7250/mo
Nice! Which company did you pick? 
As far as I know only Unicorns/Two Sigma/Citadel pay that high for interns.
Das a lot of downvotes
I'm actually looking to intern at Austin for Fall '18. Is the housing stipend actually $2500 or is it $1500?  
Holy shit. Thats INSANE for colorado. Good job. 
[deleted]
That's a solid offer! It's higher than some Big N internship salaries in areas of High CoL 
[deleted]
Congrats! Did you get referred in, or just apply online? 
legit question: is tech analyst the same as SWE?
How competitive would you say their program is?
college student here, how can I get involved in webdev for my uni? would you advise asking cs department?
Loyola/DePaul? Nice
I'm originally from the area. The surrounding area is definitely very high COL - go a bit further out and you'll be in the medium COL for sure. 
How did you get noticed? Side projects?
How was their process? I got an internship at Verizon, so I guess we're enemies now. 
That's equal to the pay of a full time.
Was this the Garage Program?
nice
Good job! 
Any start is a good one, doing undervalue yourself! :)
Come to Boise and lets grab a coffee! (tho I think the other two offers are a lot better than clearwater tbh)
[deleted]
I got matched down by $5 after telling the recruiter about a $38 offer at bulge bracket. Still chose this shop though. Are you placed in front office or back?
Congrats on your offers! I interned at Garmin this past summer, so let me know if you have any questions. I'm sure you'll love it!
We will be interning together :) if you took the offer
Same salary + benefits as last year.
[deleted]
Any reason why the new grad survey isn't out yet?
Hey ! I think you posted it as a comment to my answer instead of replying to the "US High CoL" Autobot comment ! 
BlackRock?
* From browsing the resume review threads, "resume-speak" seems to be what most people from all backgrounds struggle with. I have average experience, but it's phrased well. Get a non-CS friend to review your resume in addition to CS friends, it teaches you to explain things to non-CS audiences. 

* Previous experience via hackathons, research, and an independent project. My interviewers seemed most interested by the independent stuff and indicated that it's uncommon for underclassmen to work on things unprompted.

* Not being afraid, for lack of better wording. Several of my peers restricted themselves to the general area or didn't bother to apply at all. Don't hold yourself back. CC holds you back enough.

I could probably write a whole reddit post or medium blog on this, would people be interested in that? 
I think it's implied that it was from his side projects and/or he probably has a high average
Yup! I go to Maryland
You'll love it! A bunch of fun folks there.
It’s not enough to just apply online. In my personal opinion, I think the online pipeline is a dead end.  There’s no possible way that recruiters can pick all of the talent out of the thousands of resumes they receive.

Career fairs are a step above the online application, since you get to talk to the recruiter/engineers directly - in many cases if you make a good impression, you can get an interview and then the entire process is basically in your hands. It’s up to your technical talent to pass the interviews. Also, on campus interviews are a lot less stressful compared to phone interviews, so that’s a bonus as well.

What is best is if you can get the recruiter’s email (either through hackathons or career fairs or through other means). It’s like you’re skipping the line, and if you somehow manage to get the recruiter’s attention, you have your in. 
Wanted more of a smaller/mid-size company, so I was leaning towards Airbnb or Rubrik. Was really difficult in trying to differentiate them, since both have a ton of experienced talent to learn from, but ended up with Airbnb after consulting a ton of other people.

But I'm planning on doing Facebook in my fall semester, and I'm negotiating with Uber/Rubrik for something in the winter, so I can make the most of the opportunities that I've been given.
They pay pretty well in the NoVa area - Appian's pay was comparable to Capital One's, until they bumped up their pay to $45.

But Appian has a decent hiring bar and you actually get to work in a nice team setting on full stack/ front end development, depending on your preferences. 

Only bad thing is that they have an in house language (Sail), which is not really marketable after the experience, but they're transitioning to React/Redux development which is great to know.
Nope, just a lot of patience and learning from failure. 

There should be a thread where people post all the places they've been rejected, along with all the places they've been accepted. Then you will be able to see all the struggle that they have gone through to get to where they are.

It's all about the journey to get there, and your mindset during this journey.
I personally just rejected Microsoft for Capital One. Cap1 really really impressed me at the welcome weekend for those who received offers. Really classy company imo
I've accepted the internship offer with Microsoft! I loved my internship at Capital One but I want to see what it's like to work at a Big 4 tech company. I am strongly considering working for Capital One for full-time because of the culture, benefits, and partly because of the location.
Hey man, I appreciate it! It was a tough decision to go back to school so soon after graduating with my first degree, but I'm glad I did.

Thrilled to have landed this internship, and beyond excited to work with Amazon in Boston next summer.
Monthly. 
🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾
UCONN has a good CS program?
So they gave me a really simple quick coding challenge, I say it's maybe a step above fizzbuzz but basically leetcode easy. You got 15 minutes to solve it.

Then it's 1 interview with someone. After that it's 2 back to back interviews.

They will focus 50% on your past experiences and question you about decisions before. Some questions such as

* Why did you do X instead of Y
* What happened during your worst week at work
* Explain why do you believe what you did before was good or helpful

Then a coding question per interview that I would say it's about medium leetcode.
We apply through our school's program. They get a record of our past coops
[deleted]
haha thanks man
Primarily because I had already accepted Qualtrics early October. I also got an excellent vibe throughout the interviewing process with Qualtrics. They also flew me out to Seattle just to visit the office and I really clicked with the engineers and everything just felt right. Another big reason is because I essentially got to choose which team to work for at Qualtrics and already know what I'll be working on. As far as Uber's prestige goes, I'm still a sophomore and I got an interview there this year, so having Qualtrics on my resume for next year shouldn't hurt me in getting interviews. 
yeah that's true. made an edit on the post. 
got it pushed back
Nope, just had a personal website and some class assignments/projects. It might've helped a lot that my school is heavily recruited from them and that I had a high GPA.
ViaSat and others came to a STEM career fair on campus. They asked some foundational questions that I was quite comfortable with from being a tutor at my community college and the had me come back the next day for a technical interview. One of the things they said stood out about me was being comfortable with talking about the material, even if I was just giving an analogy for an answer as opposed to a textbook definition
Where did you hear this from?
[deleted]
[deleted]
It would be interesting to see what percentage of CS students even get an internship. My guess is 10-20%. I would have killed for even a minimum wage paying one but instead I worked my junior year summer at a CA theme park.
Mine didn't but it's very common for tech companies especially in the Bay Area 
Lol their salaries were probably raised to that then. The $12.50/hour was a legit offer though, I was there when the hiring manager announced that that would be the salary. I guess at the time they didn't realize it was illegal. 

I know they have multiple offices in the area but I checked the minimum wages in those cities and 12.50 is still too low. 
huh no, its 12, was 10.5 till last year

Edit: wrong. See comment. 
The only two that Amazon considers premium is NYC and the Bay Area. 
Don't know for sure, but my guess is GS realized they weren't attracting much tech talent since 85k prorated wasn't on-par with other top tech companies. So they increased their pay only for tech while keeping the others (banking, securities) the same since they know they can continue to attract top talent for more traditional finance roles.
judging by the pay, most likely IMC or Akuna
my mans
Yup
Who dis
The quant fund is for sure TS, so I'm guessing the prop shop is JS. 
I think that's the typical internship length in finance since they usually only have one internship "class" that begins all at one time (as opposed to Google or Facebook which have many start dates over the summer); for example all my ibanking friends' internships are 10 weeks long. Since the internship needs to accommodate both quarter and semester systems with its single start date, the natural consequence is a shorter internship length
Nice!! Yeah I think we've corresponded via PM before. 

It seems like lots of new hires are going to Azure.
I think it's standardized
They're really big on culture fit but thats hard to convey on the resume screen.

Open source contributions, ability to be flexible in language/tools, work experience.

Golang, docker, kubernetes, distributed systems and networking knowledge are much appreciated there.

Would be happy to stay in contact and tell you more about my experience next summer if you'd like.
Ya luckily for me I'm a local
Yea I was wondering that also. Maybe Two Sigma
[deleted]
I applied end of August/September and got my offers by end of October.
I rejected the offer so this is from memory and might be a mistake. 
I researched something in simulations.
I applied for Req 1700010974 in late September. They told our school that we needed to have our applications in by Sep 27th in order to be considered for an on-site at the local Boeing factory in early October. I received an offer letter a week after the on-site.

Final internship placement doesn't happen until January / February so I'd imagine they're still looking at applicants.
They didn't give me too long haha, I just started the interview process pretty early (early August), and told them about my Uber deadline
No, I'm considering the startup since I really like their product. It's also the best place to make an impact since it's small.

Optiver gave me a bad vibe during their onsite, there's a super academic culture there, where knowledge of math and algos is valued a lot - which is fine, but it seemed like noone did ANYTHING else. Programming is not my life, it's just something I kind of enjoy. I don't think I'd fit in.

I'm interviewing with Facebook now, and I'll probably go there if I pass the interviews. Unfortunately, I was rejected by Google after the on-site :(
I'm a returning intern getting my MS. I received a FT offer at the end of my last internship and converted it into another internship.

I think my unusual number is because I converted an FT offer into a return internship offer.

edit: proof - removed
Pre-tax
Before, it counts as taxable income.
The recruiter for my school reached out directly telling me to apply online and then tell her when I had done so. Then from there she passed me straight onto scheduling an onsite about a week after I applied online. Does your school have a designated recruiter by any chance? 

If you mean from the onsite, I got a call from the recruiter there exactly 1 week after the interview. 
I thought my main companies were fairly equal in terms of my interests/experience and the teams/projects/mentors I would get to interact with, all of which was important to me.


I interned in NYC the past couple of summers and absolutely love it there so location ended up being one the main deciding factors.
Got referred but I believe their application might have been open for a brief time? 
No extensive research background, but I'm passionate about Data Science and was (hopefully) able to convey that to my interviewers.
It willl be 2500("standard location") ~~but I think Seattle would end up in the premium section since they base it on the average single bedroom apt~~ wrong
I have no idea lol that's just the number that was in my letter. Initially the recruiter told me 7250 as well so I was surprised.
Maybe he included housing stipend on top of salary?
I know Amazon puts Austin and Seattle in the same COL bracket for salary (unrealistic but fortunate), so I assumed this was also the case for housing stipend, but I am not 100% sure.
Im not sure if I believe it. glassdoor says close to less than half that for boulder and 55/hr is more than the full time people make. 
I think its INSANE for him.
[deleted]
This was 2yrs ago. Not sure on their standards but most people in my intern class seemed about the same. Also as a general rule, take Glassdoor with a lot of salt. They haven't been accurate with any of my salaries (and I don't give them data either).
Yeah I got the job almost a year out and had to do the security clearance stuff which definitely upped the pay rate once I was cleared.
> ChannelAdvisor?

No
Thanks! Mine was somewhat of an interesting situation. I was lucky enough to attend a high school that had 5 internship positions offered for the computer science program. I applied through my school and was offered that position after some interviewing. I'm now continuing the project as an Undergraduate intern.

For the second position I applied online, but I had a strong referral from my current manager which definitely helped secure the job.


yeah
This is only from my experience, but if you go to a school they recruit at, then not competitive at all (even easier if you go to one of their hackathons, which supposedly fast tracks you in the application process). I applied at my university career fair and got interviewed a few weeks later (one behavioral, one really easy technical).
Correct
So I should move it to Hcol then? I'm staying in Morristown in their paid housing. The job is in Basking Ridge. I think.  

Also, heyyy!!! How is the area? Houses weren't as cheap in BR as I'd have thought. They're actually pretty close to LA prices, but you get more. Maybe I was looking at the wrong neighborhoods though.  

Any advice for stuff to do during the summer? Debating on whether or not to drive my car from Cali so I have it for the summer. (Plus I'd have my desktop for games during free time) 
Met them on site at a conference. I'm really good at behavioral interviews. I practiced a ton.   

I have management experience as a GM in a retail store you've never heard of, but I doubt they cared that much.   

Really, I just knew they were going to a conference, and I made an effort to show up and do well on the interview.   

Side projects aren't great. Some Chrome extension that took me way too long, and a couple shitty class projects. 
I did a part of Verizon's and got denied so I can tell you that it's pretty much the same from a screening standpoint, but they add a very basic "hello world" - esque technical assessment at the start before the pre-recorded video interview. Then I had a live video interview with a recruiter for them to get some additional info (mostly behavioral questions and info about the program) to "sell" me to whichever office I wanted to go to. 

After that I got a call from their Atlanta office asking to set up a phone technical interview where I had some easy/medium coding questions. They were interested about space complexity moreso than time and asked me to explain my answers. 

After the coding there was some questions about concepts (some about dbs, some about runtime) and then additional behavioral questions. I got a call back within 48 hours saying I got it (probably because I mentioned that I had another offer with a deadline  3 days later). 
Yeah
Wish I was in the area and I totally would. Definitely check out Clearwater if you are in the area. I really enjoyed their interview process and they seem to be working on some really interesting things.
What makes you think that?
Grats - yea I'm about to accept (didn't sign yet because of a legal question), look forward to meeting you!
Gross. Only recently accepted the offer, I need to find out about cross-country taxation. 
It's set to come on Wednesday. Then the experienced dev thread on Friday.
Yess
I would totally read it, and congrats on the internshup!
[deleted]
Yea, I'm curious about what kind of projects and how to sell them though.
Way to go!! That is exactly how you do it! 
A free month of linked in premium and a chrome/google extension that fishes and tests emails (clearbit for instance) along with a banging resume will take you far. 
Awesome job ItsAndover. 
So what do you say to these recruiters when you email them?
Were you able to negotiate with them for winter?
Still I've never seen anyone on here with so many internships at top companies. Awesome dude! 
Northeastern University Huskies not UCONN Huskies
Thanks! Have you decided which company you are choosing? 
[deleted]
Hey dude, I'm another sophomore that accepted Qualtrics in Seattle this summer!
good luck dude, I hope it works out! sounds like a fun summer
I'm with you! Space is the goal for me as well, I think it's well worth the salary hit. Good luck at Ames - I'm hoping to hear back about some summer positions of my own. If you don't mind me asking, what's your project? 
This says otherwise, do you have a better source? https://sfgov.org/olse/minimum-wage-ordinance-mwo

Awesome, thanks!
Oh shit right!
Ohh hey! Congrats on the offer, we should meet up over the summer!
That'd be awesome, thanks!
JS provides housing for interns
Not JS
was that useful leading up to/during the consumer internship
ah! okay I applied 3 weeks after you and I didn't go through school. Well, congrats on your offer!
I interviewed for Optiver a year ago and got a similar vibe, granted I didn't get an offer.
Do you know why Google rejected you?
Ohh it's because you're a masters student. Makes a lot more sense. Return interns get a bump and masters students get a bump. You didn't have to show proof :P
Congrats on your offers!
I was wondering how did you manage to have enough time to interview for Google while having Amazon offer? Did Amazon give you a lot of time to decide?
Ah ok, makes sense. So I’d assume they’d apply bonus tax rates on it in your first paycheck. 
So after taxes, since bonus tax rate is 25%, and I’d assume federal taxes may apply to it, it would be around $6k? 
Ah ok, so you’d be receiving less than 2.5k after taxes? At that point wouldn’t corporate housing be better?
Oh wow! I guess I should have tried harder in high school, haha. No we don't have a designated recruiter - I go to a small nontarget.
I see. I always apply when they come to my school's career fair, but no one I know has ever gotten an interview with them (and they have impressive resumes in my opinion). Also I've never personally seen their application open.
It is 2.5k for Seattle.
Then he should break it down as everyone else did. Otherwise people will call bullshit and downvote him as they already are.
They build stuff for NASA, which is pretty cool.  But I think he meant the salary is insane.
That's awesome! Congrats on what sounds like an incredible college experience :)
thanks <3
Morristown can range from Medium to High COL. 

The area is very nice - it can range from medium to high COL based on the fact that Somerset/Morris counties are very ritzy areas. Lots of NYC stockbrokers, senior managers, etc. There are tons of places in Morristown that aren't super expensive though. I personally recommend The Committed Pig if you want a really good burger.

I go to school in the Midwest now and don't really travel home much. From what I've heard from friends, the nightlife in downtown Morristown actually is pretty good for the suburbia that surrounds it (if you're into that). Additionally, NYC is only a 45 minute train ride away. There's plenty of good restaurants to try in Morristown, new ones pop up all the time. Other than that, there are plentiful hiking trails in Morristown and the surrounding area (check out Jockey Hollow).

Feel free to PM me if you've got any more questions. 
socially awkward person here, do you have any advice or books for the behavioral parts of the interview? 
That sounds about right. I spoke to a recruiter in person (I value the ATT gig higher, despite their shitty housing amd flight offers). She said they hire interns with multiple previous internships and side projects. Definitely harder to get into.   

Appreciate the response. Have a good summer! 
[deleted]
I'll write something up during winter break!
[deleted]
[deleted]
Super straight to the point. What role you're applying for, why you're interested, and I attached my resume.
Unforunately, Uber has set dates (Sept-Dec, or Jan-March). I think I'll have more luck with Rubrik since they're a smaller company, so they're more flexible with requests like these.

In the worst case, I'll apply for winternships at prop shops in the spring.
damn it i knew i shouldve paid the extra and send my sat scores there. 
[deleted]
that's awesome! PM me if you wanna link up before the internship starts!
Must be a san jose thing then. Was working min wage till summer. 
Yeah for sure! It would be cool to meet cscq people in real life. 
Ehh, not really. It was basically filler for my resume.
I'm pretty bad at coding tbh
Oh didn't know that. I'll remove it haha
I got several months on my return offer for Amazon. Ask and ye shall receive.
Income is income. They'll withhold a large amount of tax when they pay you 30 days before you start. They'll pay you the remainder, minus your actual tax burden in your first paycheck.

You can change your withholding preferences to determine *when* you get the money. You'll make the same regardless after tax season.
> Ah ok, so you’d be receiving less than 2.5k after taxes?

Yes.

> At that point wouldn’t corporate housing be better?

The stipend is definitely better if you want to make more money.  I lived in Seattle the previous summer in a hacker house for about $1k/mo rent.  I shared a room, but it ended up being a really fun experience.  You can definitely get singles for less than $2.5k - taxes if you'd prefer though.
So what you could try is Microsoft's [recruiter search page](https://careers.microsoft.com/recruiters) and look within your state for a school near yours which does have a designated recruiter, and then cold-emailing them saying you applied and have an offer deadline. No guarantee this will yield a response but it's worth a shot! Otherwise, it's still fine since you have another offer; I didn't get Microsoft my freshman year so you'll have another year to try.
[deleted]
no problem! I'm about as inexperienced as they get (from what it seems like on this sub anyway) but feel free to PM if you have any more questions!
Often times companies will tell you what they want to hear.   

Kohls kept mentioning some push to Cloud services. So, I brought it up. I said it sounded exciting etc....   
Often times you can do that ya know? Interviewer mentions an experience - find a way that excites you and tell them. Show them.   

Realistically, just look up questions on Glassdoor and practice. Have answers ready for every single behavioral question. Why X company, time when you had to lead, challenge you faced, etc.   

Just smile and show them you're excited. People don't know you're awkward unless you tell them. Fake it for an hour or 30min and you'll get a job. Additionally, tune into your interviews. Read them and react accordingly. Takes more practice, but yeah it's a good skill. 

Feel free to ask anything else. 
You were correct.
Thanks for the thorough reply -- I'd love to read your write up!
[deleted]
It honestly depends on the person. I love LinkedIn reach outs because I find them easier to keep track of than an ever growing email inbox. Like for a resume revision- love LinkedIn for that. I can open it from LinkedIn and respond on there.

Or if you are reaching out after applying for a job and being like, "Hi look out for my application please. I am excited about this role because Y and think I'm a perfect fit because X." - that would also be LinkedIn. Less email clutter. 

For the application itself outside of job boards try to find an email. Because then the recruiter can just hit forward to send to the hiring manager. Keeping it easy. 
How do you get the emails of the recruiters? The last career fair at my school was in October, and only a handful of tech companies were even there.

I would say they're not bad. I think on paper they're not ranked very high, but their co-op program is exceptional. I worked at a place that hired a lot of NU co-ops and NU grads and they were nothing but excellent. Granted, we did have the pick of the litter when it came to their co-ops.
[deleted]
Dope. Not sure if I count as cscq people tho, I've only just started browsing here haha.
Really? I’ve heard research is xtremely useful for networking
I doubt that haha. You're a fine coder. Getting those internships requires a lot of skill. Good job!
Unless you want to work at that company in the future.
I’ll gladly take u up on your offer :]

I looked up JPMorgan’s hackathon, and I’m interested in their Code for Good one. Have you attended one (not JPMorgan’s specifically but in general) and if you did, do you think the all nighter was worth?
awesome, thanks! 

> interviewer mentions an experience 

Is this meaning they open up to you and tell you a story they’ve had or is this meaning they’re bringing up an experience mentioned on your resume? My only experience of interviews has been through movies, so go easy on me lol
I'd love to know more about precisely what you are doing with LinkedIn Premium. I'm not searching for a new job now, but I'd love to have this kind of knowledge for when I eventually do. 
contact them on linkedin. I have like 10-20% usually reply. Contact alumns and get referrals. got offers at multiple companies this way.
I’m already taking my fall semester off, so I’m free from November to January once my fall co-op is done. I’m using 10 weeks of this time for another internship, since I probably won’t be doing anything else during this time.

I think prop shop winterships are only a month though.
^ this was my thinking. Co-op helps place lots of people in good positions compared to other schools at NU's level
I barely network so I guess it wasn't for me.
Thanks, I just feel that I'm really slow when programming compared to everyone else. 

There comes a point where luck has a lot to do with getting the job offer, as well - for example some of the interviews went in-depth on topics I have a lot of experience with. I may have a strong grasp of those specific ones, but the breadth of my knowledge is very limited, and I don't think they evaluated how much I don't know. Had I been asked a different question, I don't know that I would have gotten the offers. I feel very lucky to have been in my position at the right time.
I've been to one, honestly not really a fan of the whole staying up all night eating junk food, but a lot of people enjoy it and it's a great way to meet people and work on pretty cool stuff at any skill level. If you've never been to one I'd recommend it just for the experience
Its both. Here's a crappy example.   
I asked)    
What opportunities do you have for career growth or progression? Do you promote based on years in the seat or can someone rise quickly based on performance?   

They said)   
We had someone do X to accomplish Y and we later promoted him to Z.   

You say)  
Bla bla Im excited to showcase my skills like X did so I can rise too.   

That's a trash example, but you get the idea. Just go with the flow. Relate back to what they're saying. If you ramble, end with a summary.   
E. G. Ramble ramble... So my strengths are x y z. You brought it back despite rambling.   

I'd practice verbally. 
Sure thing! 
So there's lots of ways to find people on LinkedIn (like a site search on google) that are free, but using premium keeps my sanity. It's a million times easier to search for people. You can put in the title, company, etc. So finding a tech recruiter at a company you want to apply to takes less than a minute. 

You also see who has viewed your profile (and can reach out to them - they might be looking for someone like you and assumed you weren't interested!) and you get a few in mails. Sometimes you need them if the person doesn't connect with you. Then you can tell them what you are reaching out to them about. If they respond you get your in mail credit back. 

Some recruiters might have too many connections and not be allowed to add more- that's rare though! 

Not all postings will always be online. Some companies use agencies like mine, some look at referrals first before resorting to posting, and some jobs are just about to open up. So being proactive and connecting with people that hire at companies you love often pays off! 

I love the LinkedIn searching. It's worth it to me. I often look up people for my candidates if they have a dream company they want to apply to. Anything to avoid applying to the apply button black holes! 
[deleted]
haha, yeah, sleep schedule will definitely be fucked for *days* after the hackathon. I’ll definitely go at least once for the experience.


ooohh, I got it now. Thanks!
Nope - I don’t think fall internships are worth it if you delay your graduation (unless you’re desperate for experience).

You get taxed for the value of housing. It's treated as income so you might want to ask them if they kick you back extra for taxes for the housing
Wow! Two Sigma? Jane Street? Congrats by the way

I'm confused, you accepted 3 different offers for the same summer duration?
Could you describe the process of how you got in and stuff? Like any information you want to share at all? Currently in 2nd year Macquarie 
Enjoy! Best term I ever had.
Hey how was it at shopify? I'm a U of O  second year student and was thinking of applying there.
hi, I'm also from Calgary, are there open applications for Nexen's program?
Sounds like a great internship, do you mind me asking what you did there?

It's in the op.
I don't even get why CoL is relevant for interns tbh  cause most companies in high CoL areas pay for housing anyway 
ugh yeah, I know.  I like the company, I lived at home which means  no living expense, so I just kind of got complacent with the low pay.  
I do have a full time offer, but am really looking to move out of the midwest, so whether I accept or not will depend on how interviews go during the school year.
No, it's a decent sized company, but most people haven't heard of it 
Probably Amazon 
I don't really like school. It's expensive and I'm really bad at math so I'm never in school for more than a semester. Add to me taking a gap year before I started college.

I just recently switched majors away from CS though so time will tell.
How wtf
To be honest I'm not too sure re post tax, this offer is for the upcoming summer so I don't have too much info there. I do know that the signing bonus is 5k post tax (they actually give you ~9k) and that they give you a bit of extra money to cover the intended extra tax on the housing. The $1500 transportation cost and other perks are taxed normally, however.   
The signing bonus is for being a returning intern, I wouldn't have gotten it if I didn't intern there this summer! 
I mean I won't know for sure until I start next summer but I don't think it qualifies as that. When I got the offer they didn't tell me the price they just told me the unit. I looked online and found out how much they were paying for it and was pretty blow away since it looks like a normal one bedroom (just a very nice one). But I think it's just because it's an apartment in lower Manhattan. Lots of rich people want to live near work so the prices are through the roof.
Jane Street pays interns in London about 7000 pounds a month.
you're calling bullshit because he's qualified and got a good offer? Lmao
[deleted]
Not Wayfair, but I know a lot of people who just interned there! 
After getting all the others (it was my last interview) I didn't think things got any better without going into finance haha. 
I'll be interning the whole year, I accepted one for Winter/Spring, one for Summer and one for Fall
Sure, csiro runs vacation scholarships every summer so you just apply through the website in June-July and then submit a cover letter + cv. There are hundreds of projects in a bunch of fields so just pick an interesting one. Then I went in for an interview about a month ago, and got an email saying I was in last week. 
Not currently. I think they open them early May
At my previous internship? I did a lot of data visualization work and created dashboards for execs at Shaw. Also wrote code in python for formatting data to be able to feed it into the data viz's
Well I imagine COL plays a huge role here 
Come on man, you're worth more than that
What did you TA?
Amazon definitely doesn't cover uber costs 
Amazon has a larger stipend and smaller base
oh but how do you land those internships as a sophomore? are you fairly experienced with programming prior to college?
[deleted]
Jane Street is not really a "regular" firm. Those salaries are not "regular" at all (from a Dutch perspective).

You know who make 7k a month here? Fucking senior bank managers or some shit, not fucking interns!


The numbers don't make sense! $16,000 monthly total compensation for an intern? I mean yes, if he/she's a PhD intern, doing advanced financial / ML software with a good previous experience then I might get convinced. But for a sophomore/junior college student? I'm not quite sure about that... - It's just my opinion though.
Why am I getting downvoted...
[deleted]
Late reply, but congrats on getting the internship in 2nd year. How'd you manage to get in without prior experience though? I know only 1 person who got in and he has just under 7 GPA and did research experience the year before (he's 3rd year atm), seemed like they set a really high bar for their interns and expected 3rd years. Maybe I should've applied when applications were open haha
Thank you! 
Sounds like fun! And what about Nexen?
I was a TA for Discrete Math in the Spring (which was when I got the internship), but I'm now a TA for Computer Organization & Programming
The pay and housing stipend is very similar to amazon intern packages I've seen though, so maybe this recruiter just was more lenient? 
For training they do. One of my friends was interning there last summer and during his week of training out in Seattle (he was based in DC) they told him to take Uber every day and covered it all.
Pretty much. I started writing code around 12 because I wanted to make video games but things changed. I was not a huge social kid so anytime I was home was spent by me on Google figuring out how to do things. Somewhere it all just started to add up but I don't think I'm close to where I want to or need to be.

I also self taught myself everything I know about DS and Algorithms.

EDIT: this xkcd comic pretty much defined my teenage years https://xkcd.com/519/
A nice one bedroom in a great part of manhattan is 2K. Then around 4K once you look at high rises. 7k is mad
The companies that you see here are not "regular" either. Regular salaries in the US are not $100k for interns.

Also, you have to compare the US to Europe, not to the Netherlands (not really the best paying country for software engineers). I personally am making over $100k in London, and there are quite a few companies paying that sort of money, even for entry level people (Google, Facebook, some startups and hedge funds pay juniors ~$100k). You can also make $300k at Google Zurich and pay 20% tax (sometimes less), get great reasonably priced healthcare and more vacation than in the US. And still be <2h away from home by plane. So yeah, Europe is worse than the US for software engineers, but it's not *that* bad.

Also, US companies regularly take interns from Europe, feel free to apply to those internships paying $10k a month, you'll see it's not that trivial to get them.
if you include housing, a lot of top companies pay close to that amount. Two Sigma pays 10.6K/month + housing for their interns in new york, which comes out to around that amount as well. Citadel does 10K/month + housing. it's definitely an anomaly, and very few people are getting these kinds of offers. Some of my friends who interned at Big-4 companies got destroyed in these financial company interviews
Are you going to be ok?
Winter 2018 (till April), Summer 2018 (till August) and Fall 2018 (till end of December)
It seemed to me that different areas have quite varied levels of interest. I had plenty of friends apply for the Data61 places who heard nothing back at all, but when I went in for my interview they told me I was one of two that had made it to the interview stage. My grades are pretty decent and I did my best to really sell myself in the cover letter. Hope this helps!
Nice. If you're a TA for those classes you can definitely get a really good job.  
maybe they changed the package but for the current interns, we didn't get relocation stipend. They book our tickets directly. I had to pay for baggages as well which is why I didn't think this would be Amazon 
The recruiter doesn't get to decide whether your uber costs are covered. By company policy they are not. 
that's odd. most out-of-state interns/NHs were set up in fairly nearby hotels. Also with orca cards covering most rides over the state, its surprising they covered Uber costs
oh, that's cool. congrats on your offer again!

Spot on.
Jane Street puts you in NYU summer housing where you room with 1 or 2 others. When I got their offer 2 years ago it was their first time bumping up the intern offer to 10.4k/mo, which, if you add housing, still doesn't come close to 16k/mo, unless you consider +/- $4k to be "close to that amount".

Two Sigma also does roommate housing, but there's no way they're going in at at least 10k/mo for a room.
Wait. What I have concluded from this sub is that employees working in cities with high CoL receive higher salaries because they have to pay more for rent (and other expenses, but mainly rent) than people in smaller cities, and hence the higher salary. But what you're saying is that most companies pay for housing. Unless you're talking EXCLUSIVELY about interns..?
[deleted]
Oh I'd probably be applying for Data61 as well, looks like I'll really have to polish up my resume for next year. I haven't got a cover letter either so I'll have to really make an outstanding one for next year as well, seems half of the companies I've looked into want a CV/resume/references. Hopefully the internship is a good experience
I hope so, lol
Not sure who your recruiter was but I was definitely offered a relocation stipend.
If you're interning in a non-Seattle office, they often fly you in for NHO in Seattle for the first week. 
Eh, Hell's Kitchen 1 br is about 1.7K
Just interns. You're not getting housing paid for unless you're on an expat package. 
Thanks :). I applied and asked if I could-- a bunch of places will take Waterloo co-ops and do year-round programs as a result, but it's typically less-advertised. 
[deleted]
Dude Hell's Kitchen is a really nice part of manhattan I have no idea what you mean. Every typical NYC movie basically happens to have HK has its main neighborhood if you will. 

I've been living in manhattan for 5 years I kind know the prices. Plus that's not including the fact that if you use a a real estate agent, you can usually find much cheaper deals

[deleted]
For real. I pay $2600 for a studio in the Financial District. That's "nice". A nice one bedroom is about $4000 around here. FiDi is a relatively cheap Manhattan neighborhood too.

Dude I won't know what to  Wall you man. HK is probably the nicest area in terms of price/quality of neighborhood and it's slapped in the dead center of the city

Sign on bonus AND housing for an intern? wow
Are you a returning MSFT intern? It seems like a returning intern package
Congrats. How were you able to get all those internships despite going to an unknown school? Career fairs? Great side projects? 
BTW, 7.2k isn't $45 an hour - there's about 4.33 weeks not 4 in a month. 
would you kindly explain how on earth you have 4 prior internships as a rising junior? were they all swe internships?
Can someone explain to me why Bloomberg is a thing? I hear nothing about them in any context outside of this subreddit. 
is the free corporate housing worth it?
Is this more than the Seattle offers?

How is the housing?

You got into Jump? How was the technical for that? I used to work at a trading firm and their technical for the dev program was honestly not hard but I still didn't pass. Hell, Wolverine didn't even call me back at all lol
[deleted]
Which Chicago trading firm was your offer from if you don't mind me asking? You can PM it if you're more comfortable doing that
unlimited free flights is dope! if it only lasts until the end of the internship though you probably won't be able to use it
Holy shit unlimited flights
Wtf im legitimately jelly.
If you have unlimited flights, I  suppose you have some PTO to use them?
I can tell which defense contractor this is based on the pay lol, interned there twice. Good luck!

Dude.....how did you get convinced to take unpaid?

Idk i've been told so many times to never take unpaid and that almost 100% of the time youre getting scammed.
:(
can confirm.
[deleted]
Is that Bayern or Baden- Württemberg? Huge city or a small one?
how many h/week do you work?

you should probably ask for a raise...
Almost sure I know what company that is. How has your experience been?
is $540 a month really livable in Poland? That would barely cover my rent and utilities and I live in a not so nice part of town in a low COL area in the U.S.
Good suggestion, in the future I shall do that.
I was really happy with the package, yeah :) I found it to be competitive with all and even superior to some other major cs companies.
The bonus is for returning, everything else is part of the normal package a first-time SWE Intern would see.
I never found that school name really mattered.
I started in high school. The first few were more on the hardware side.
Same with Citadel in my experience
I'm not quite sure what kind of answer you're looking for.
afaik, not really. Microsoft has a very tight band for SWE intern pay.

From my Seattle based friends, I've seen 7100 ~ 7600. Also, I haven't yet asked any of my peers, what they've got so can't give you a good data point on that (Cambridge vs Seattle).
Freshman then I'm assuming? Start by always putting in time outside of class to learn something and build your own projects. Pursue your own curiosities. 

Can't think of a project? Bug every professor about doing research. Learn a language or two very well by writing your own code and working on others code like open source. 

Buy a cheap server and learn all you can about linux and running apps/sites on it. Throw together a project that includes a frontend and database using version control before the end of your first year. This will put you way ahead for your first year no matter the school. 

Personally I got it by applying with no referrals online. Extremely hard to do so you need to find a way to network early and get referrals.    

It's a lot of work and only about a 1k get here. But its worth it 3x over. 
i think he didn't say the name of a company for a reason.
Yeah! I'll PM
Yeah..
I've seen the housing at NYU. 

It's not pretty

Found the government/DoD contractor
Got lucky I guess. Went to engineering fair and CS fair and handed out my resumes, then got an email from my manager starting off the interviewing process. Talked to him on the phone and I guess he had a good impression so he told me to do an onsite. Onsite was two interviewing sessions with two different pairs of employees, then a lunch with the manager. Got the good news a few weeks later, and negotiated to where I am now.

Going to both fairs actually mattered in this case because I'm an EE and my manager told me that they only had time to review the resumes they got in the CS fair before the rest went in the gutter because there were too many qualified candidates. My resume was decent because I took coding classes in my HS and went to several hackathons in the fall that I mostly talked about because I did not have any CS classes at all this year.
I got one too. It takes some luck in order to get an interview (applied at career fair), but IBM interviews are generally very easy - just two discussions about projects. 

I had a few Node.js projects on my resume while being an ECE major at the time and I got an offer at a team that works on Node on IoT. 
Haven't moved in yet, but from pictures, it looks nice. The location is very central, it's right on the river in River North. I can try to update when I see it.
Interview discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6fco6u/salary_sharing_thread_for_interns_june_2017/diitsvo/

I'm doing C++ dev, so presumably execution speed
It was definitely one of the harder technical interviews I've had.

The screening round wasn't very tough, one easy problem, which they then asked about parallelization, and then discussing projects.

On site was 4 rounds, some OOP C++ stuff,  I was open about my skill level in C++ (low to no), but still wanted to interview for C++ dev positions, so they were a little more forgiving of me when I didn't know the answer to something C++ specific, although my knowledge of OOP from Java probably helped.

The algorithm questions started easier but then for one I got a second question that I couldn't solve optimally (O(m + n) solution, best I got was O(min(m log(n), n log(m)). I think my reasoning about my solution and how to improve it helped me here, even if it didn't ultimately improve the speed.

I suspect that Jump places a heavy emphasis on school prestige for their recruiting so that probably helped me too.

Yeah, I actually got them in that order reversed (got the offer from Fidelity first). After getting the initial offer it seemed like I was building up momentum and the offers kept coming. And each one turned out to be better than the previous one. However, I did spend a few months failing interviews. I learned from some of my failures and got better at interviewing (at least behavioral... technical side still needs a lot of work). Keep in mind most of these firms are finance which are light on the technical questions. The trading firm did not ask me any coding questions since it is a trading role.
I got 5 and was disappointed....
not true. Flew on 7 flights this weekend.
No PTO but you can Work your 40 hours so that you get a half day Friday or off Friday. In terms of tiredness I feel like my cs classes is more tiring than flying a lot.  
They could also just go somewhere every weekend
Thanks! What office?
Thanks! I'm taking 6 years to graduate, for better or worse... I would be working on internal tools for Madden NFL 18.

It's in the metropolitan area of Stuttgart
I'm already done with the internship. Standard 40 hour week. My friends got 220 and 200 per month so it seems I got a really good deal. Maybe something to do with local laws or cultural differences. Never heard of people making thousands per month in internships really. Maybe also because it's an internship necessary for my degree.
Normal wage for a third year internship here. I got €180 at a very tiny startup. Other in my class also got from €150 to €300.  
I'm now I'm my fourth year and I get €500 a month.  
Don't want to share where and such with this account though 
Salary for internship is not meant to make you live based on it (at least in Poland). It's just a pleasant addition at the very beginning of your career.
When I move to Junior Software Developer position afterwards I will get around $1000 per month and that is pretty livable if you live reasonably.
It is. But you can get internships there for $1500/month and more.
Not that it is easy, but possible
Shouldn't your salary be higher than $7200 if you're a returning intern. I know returning interns generally get salary raises as well. I'm not sure this applies if you were previously an explorer intern though. 
I love this mentality. You sound like someone who busts their ass. 
Citadel is huge wut. It's one of the biggest HFTs in the world as well as being one of the biggest asset managers and hedge funds. I guess if you're not into finance you won't know them or hear about them. Just think Two Sigma, and to a lesser degree Jane street, Goldman Sachs etc.
Tell me about bloomberg.  Why do they pay so well?  What work do they have you guys doing?  Why do they (seem to) hire so many developers?  What makes them different from other seemingly similar companies.  
>Personally I got it by applying with no referrals online.

How many did you apply to before you got it? What kind of projects were you listing on your resume?
It's pretty obvious from the housing....
If it's NYU the location can't be too bad though. 
Im not completely sure why you'd ever take a non-compensating dev job, especially in the D.C/Metro area. There are so many contractors that pay north of 20 an hour.
Actually no, I work for a public company in medical tech industry

Damn, where did you go?

Or go to lunch somewhere cool. I'd take a free flight to SoCal for some Weinerschnitzel. 
Yeah, but if you fly far it can be time consuming. Not to mention tiring.
Cherry Hill
When you're a freshman, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Good job on getting the opportunity to get experience, I remember how tough it was as a freshman. I tried hard to find a job and didn't even find an unpaid one. Even if this one is unpaid, it's increasing your earning potential down the line as long as you keep yourself growing.
sick, that's though luck...

Damn sounds like a dream company/s
> Why do they pay so well

I  imagine it's to attract new top talent, plus they are located in a very high COL area.

> What work do they have you guys doing?

Their main product is the Bloomberg Terminal, a piece of financial hardware and software that many other top financial companies use. A lot of people work on that. They also have a news department, see www.bloomberg.com.

> Why do they hire so many developers? 

I don't know.

> What makes them different from other seemingly similar companies.

I suppose the Terminal is a unique product on the market and it requires large groups of different people working together (engineers, financial people, sales, etc)
bloomberg is essential for finance/banking. Everyone in banking uses bloomberg terminal, and the cost per license per year (according to a quick google search) is $20,000. They essentially aggregate financial data, which banks/hedge funds/other finance companies use. This makes them a buttload of money.
How many times did I apply to fb? Once last year which ended in no response / no interview. This year applied once and got it. 

If you meant how many times for any swe internship I would say less then 20. Even though I would recommend applying to a lot more.  

Projects included a mobile app, some security work, and a chat bot. 
Welp, your comment got deleted
It's like 15 minute walk, but you generally have to room with other Goldman interns (or at least, you can). 
Oneway to Austin for the day then up to Chicago for the night, my airline was launching service to a city the next day so I got to be an inaugural flight for that (x2). I than needed two flights to get home. I'm a big airplane geek so that's why I decided to that. :) 
Cherry Hill or Moorestown?
I feel like this is the point that got overlooked here
I mean it pays a shit ton lmao
FYI, that wasn't me - I'm just saying, it's obviously that wishlist unicorn website
Their research department in in Cherry Hill.
Gotcha. Didn't know they had a facility there. I'm in Moorestown. 

I'd also like to take a moment and appreciate that anybody reading this thread could very easily discern the company now.
Look man, no

Outsiders

Could ever conclude what company this is. Unless threatened at

Knife point, I would never reveal it.

Heed my warning though.

Everyone there is 

Egregiously terrible at documentation.

Don't fall victim to bad practices.
Idk what's going on with that formatting but dm me if you're at all trying to make a serious point

Edit: Alright alright, people. I get it now, no need to continue explaining it lol
First letters spell Lockheed. 
Read the first letters of each line. 
Use your critical thinking skills. I wonder what it spells out...
Wow I'm stupid
It's Monday my dude.
